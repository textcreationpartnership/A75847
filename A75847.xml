            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170225:7"/> vvill I frame all ſo intelligibly as I can, yea and ſo plauſibly, as the intelligiblenes of the matter wil ſuffer. In reading this Book, make that uſe thereof, which the Author intends, who ſaith, that the <hi>1 Cor. 8.</hi> plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainly enough reproveth all ſwaying the Conſcience in purpoſe or practice, by and for any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſpect of the Teacher, or fore-practice, even under great cenſures therein expreſſed: Wherefore (ſaith he) I will fear and flee what I can from all perſwading the Conſcience, but by helping it to underſtand the Conſcience-ſwaying Word of God, by the rules thereof, and our enlighted reaſon natural in natural things and matters of fact, and especially ſpiritual, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from the Poſitions of Faith, and received therewith and thereby.</p>
                  <p>So aſſuring my ſelf, that the ſincere and ſerious Seekers and Lovers of Truth, will find a large Field of Knowledge for themſelves to walk in (with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety) in the unfolding of <hi>Adams</hi> ſeveral Eſtates in <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> Alſo, that Chriſtian temper of love, mercy, compaſſion, pity, forbearance, and forgiveneſs, <hi>(Jam. 3.17, 18.</hi> (lively diſplayed) which ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed for the reſtoring of an offending brother: with the odiouſneſs of the contrary proud perſecuting car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:</p>

                  <p>IN this Treatiſe of Divine Worſhip, for avoiding Ambiguity, I wil firſt handle the noture, and then the nature thereof: Worſhip is taken three wayes, 1. Perſonally, and that both inſtinctively, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively. 2. Really, or ſubjectively. 3. Actively, and tranſiently between both. In the firſt it is taken for the venerable perſonage or ſtate of Superiority, as <hi>Majeſty, Grace, Highneſs, Lordſhip, and VVorſhip,</hi> are vulgarly uſed for a King, Duke, Lord, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. In the ſecond, for the reſpective things and works of their Inferiors, impoſed upon them by their Superiors, as their claimed due by their Superiority. In the third, for the Inferiors exerciſing thoſe things and works towards their Superiors; but in that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we uſe it properly in the ſecond ſenſe; yet for want of uſual conjugates proper to each of the three and through their affinity, if we had them, we will ſtill allow alſo an obvious reſpect of the third, as tranſient to the firſt, as its rightful commander, and proper α. &amp; ω. <hi>i. e.</hi> its beginning and end; Divine alſo we uſe in the ſame manner, properly for the

Again, thirdly, the will of God hath the ſame three fold ſenſe in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but it is here appropriated to the ſecond, by the word inſtituted, and ſo giveth the diſtinguiſhing term to this definition, as it doth the conſtituting by its making the church and its eccleſiaſticalls, parts of Divine worſhip. 4. Service, or ſerving God, may be taken for the works of Gods perſonall ſervice, and ſecondly, for his inſtituted, but partly for want of fitter terms, and partly for the diſtinction of the two latter ſenſes of worſhip mentioned, I will conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe it for the third ſenſe of worſhip, or exerciſe of worſhip: In the ſecond ſenſe for the peculiar publike ſerving God, and as tranſient from us to God, as I will alſo for the ſame reaſons uſe the ſubjective wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the matter thereof, and worſhip in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſenſe, wherewith both the naturall and natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall uſe of the word well agreeth; for the Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy thereof is from the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>High Dutch</hi> words <hi>voorſt,</hi> Lord, or <hi>voerſt</hi> firſt, and <hi>Schapſhip,</hi> which is their, and our uſuall ſtative abſtract, both making <hi>vorſtſchap, (quaſi</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond requiſite is, to epitomiſe and effigiat the Tree of this matter, ſo much proſequted, that it may the better be diſcerned whether it be that tree of Gods planting, of Paradiſe, and of Life, which it is pretended to be, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether its roots draw ſap from the River, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, and be fructified by the divine heat thereof, and the Negation of their contraries, and be of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, variety, and preciouſneſs of fruit, which the Tree of Gods ſpeciall worſhip ought to do and be; onely becauſe I fear I ſhal be too much ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if I ſhould ſet it and its explanation together, (as is fit) in this page, and alſo confuſe the matter; I will refer it to another place, and in this place col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and ſet the ſum of the Arguments which this place yeildeth for the proving the diſtinctneſs of the Offices in kinde, which is the third and laſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to this place; they are of three ſorts, according to the three parts of the tree, <hi>viz.</hi> the Root, Body and Branches, each yeilding five.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, becauſe they are integrall, and hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal parts of Gods worſhip as inſtituted, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170225:49"/> or in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and ſo are fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of the diſtinctneſs of the immediate image, means and repreſentation of God, the breaking the bands and bounds, whereof is the moſt proper object of Gods higheſt jealouſie, hatred and curſe, except the ſins againſt the firſt commandment, in the ſame, or a higher degree, and it is annexed only to the ſecond, as moſt needing the ſame, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>worſhip of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond, in that they are inſtitutions, and not grounded on the generall Light of Nature, and therefore are to be obſerved in the ſtricteſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diverſitie, at leaſt in a true and proper differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entneſs, manyneſs, and not oneneſs, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of them, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. this is proved <hi>v.</hi> 1. in that they are parts of <hi>that word-worſhip of God;</hi> but all morall ſins are ſo, without, and before the Word.</p>
                  <p>The third is, That they are ſeverally meaſured out, <hi>v.</hi> 3. not one in Function, and many parts of one body, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. and divers, and proportioned, <hi>v.</hi> 6. by the expreſs <hi>will of God, v.</hi> 2. <hi>that will of God, that good and acceptable, and perfect one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth, in that the contrary ſuppoſition and practiſe, is called overwiſeneſs, immodeſty, and breaking the particular meaſure of God, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And fifthly, conformity to the world, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Theſe five from the generall Root, do ſtrongly prove the point, if the Offices and their diſtinctneſs be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars thereof, <hi>i. e.</hi> parts of Gods worſhip, as inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Word, as lovingly to us, acceptably to himſelf, and perfectly in it ſelf, willed by God, and as oppoſed by the wit, immodeſty, and unboundedneſs of man, and by the like cuſtoms of the world: Now that the Offices are ſo, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170225:50"/> becauſe they are expreſly named, and by the ſame reaſon is their diſtinctneſs in kinde to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince otherwiſe they are not divers many, nor one, nor ſtinted Officers, but the ſame in kinde, and not many; one, and not ſtinted out portions of faith; only the perſons are according to their gifts to uſe them diverſly in meaſure, which is no miniſteriall difference, nor in ſtate, office, or place, but only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, in gifts and degree, which altereth not the kinde.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Argument: And firſt, from the body of the Tree is, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>as we have many members in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> thus; What kinde of oneneſs is meant in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that kind of manyneſs is meant in the members: but in the body is meant oneneſs in kind: therfore the major I ſuppoſe that neither Scholler nor ingenious will deny; the minor alſo none deny in our caſe, that I know, to have expreſſed themſelves: the Papiſts holding one Church in particular, and the hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians one in kinde, but of a divers kinde from ours: but of neither of theſe we have now to do; and all reformed Churches, holding the ſame with us, that it is a Congregation.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh is from the ſame words, thus: Such diverſity is meant between the Offices, as is between the members of our body, that is, heterogeneal, and not only individuall and graduall, therefore this alſo: if this yet convict not of it ſelf, as me thinks it ſhould, <hi>Pauls</hi> ground being from our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which have not one and the ſame work, and not from the branches of a Tree which have, except of the Tree of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. Caſt but the eye on the conſonant reflexes on every ſide, on the ſix for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Arguments, eſpeciall the ſixt, and on the more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170225:50"/> and more clear, following eſpecially on the next; and it wil, if any thing will.</p>
                  <p>The eight is alſo from the ſame, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>but all thoſe members have not the ſame work;</hi> theſe are the expreſs oppoſite words and matter to thoſe that oppoſe me herein, for they ſay the Paſtors office hath alſo the ſame work with the reſt, eſpecially with the overſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offices, and they alſo with the reſt, and with the Paſtor, only occaſions, gifts, order, and arbitrary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement may make a difference, yea and ought; but God hath not ſtinted and apportioned certain works to certain offices, ſo as when the church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituteth a Teacher, an Exhorter, and a Ruler, they ſhould ſhare out all the overſeeing Ordinances into three portions, functions, or deſigned works, which ſhould adaequately terminate their offices, and ſo make them diſtinct in kinde: this place ſaith the flat contrary, except they will flee to extraordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or to verball cavills, or elſe to inconveniences, as if they be Miniſters of Chriſt, (or rather of the Church) and not his Saints, they will not ſuffer themſelves to be hampered, yoked, and bound with his bands and cords, but oppoſe them and their courſes, that indeavour it as from Chriſt, ſo as they ſhal finde <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The tenth yet proceedeth a degree higher, (though neerer nothing can) ſhewing, that though no civill nor religious Office of mans making have indeed any ſuch, Internall Diſtinctneſſe whereby this matter might be the better expreſſed; yet thoſe of the Church have in reſpect of, or by the Law and inſtitution of Chriſt, v. 5. <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not only the diverſneſs and manineſs of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or offices, and ordinances of the church; but alſo the oneneſs, combination, or ſtateneſs of the church it ſelf, are proved to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> even of Chriſts own ordaining.

If I ſhould grant the ground, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would not follow, if the preſent matter and ſcope require that ſenſe here; nay, whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs of Offices be in kind or degree, it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both ſides, that it is by Chriſts appointment, and if it be not elſewhere expreſſed, it ſhould the eaſilier be granted that it is ſo here; but the words are, and are to be applied to the outward reſpects of Chriſt, ſo oft as to the inward, as ſeemeth by <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.9, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.17. &amp; 12.2, 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170225:53"/> the main matter would be cleer enough to the right Worſhippers; yet, as this ſecond ſort of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being from the body of this place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and of Gods Worſhip inſtituted therein, is more cleerly to our point than the firſt, from the ſoul and root of both; ſo is the third ſort more expreſs than the ſecond, even ſo much as the <hi>members</hi> or <hi>branches</hi> do more manifeſt the manifold powers of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <hi>baſis,</hi> than they themſelves, as may out of what followeth, and by further proſecuting of what it occaſioneth unto, be well diſcerned by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the renovation of their minds, that have the free power of themſelves, and their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings from under Antichriſtianiſm, cuſtome of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and themſelves, and prejudice.</p>

To an abſtract both in gifts and offices, and therefore if there be but four or five men in a church gifted with propheſie, or with one language, or made Deacons, it cannot be ſaid that Church hath divers gifts, tongues, and offices in it in the abſtract, but only divers gifted perſons, and divers officers in the concrete.</p>

                     <p>A third or ſixt anſwer is from the predicate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed in the ſame clauſe, to <hi>divers,</hi> viz. <hi>according to that grace given unto us,</hi> which alſo is itterated in the ſame verſe; in, <hi>according to that meaſure of that faith,</hi> both referring us to <hi>v.</hi> 3. and ſo inferring the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars following upon the preceeding generals, and both being anſwered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. with 8. to 11. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. wherein alſo are three ſorts or heaps of Arguments couched, which I muſt but touch: The firſt is in the words themſelves; firſt, laying the cauſe of that diſtinctneſs in Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and free Will, not in mans diſcretion, or will, for reaſons within himſelf, in the former Clauſe.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170225:55"/> And ſecondly; In the <hi>proportion of faith,</hi> which is here ſet as the formall Reaſon, or ſoul of our Church-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, whether membral, proper, and immediate, <hi>faith</hi> being the reſpect or cauſe why we have right to be Members of that State, and why all other gifts are given unto us, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. to 48. &amp; 20.8.32. and ſo why we are capable of the Offices of the Church, according to which meaſure, whether of Memberſhip, Gifts or State, we are to actuate that we have received diſtinctly, not confuſedly, <hi>i. e.</hi> of each according to his own Rules and Order, not of any of the other two, as of the State or Offices, by the Rules thereof, not of gifts properly and immediately, though the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was given to us in reſpect of fit gifts therefore; yet now the predominant and denominant, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituter and diſtinguiſher, and the proper ſubject of order, is the office or ſtate it ſelf, and that only, though they be alſo both Members and gifted, which have alſo their proper Rules, which we are alſo to obſerve in their reſpect, as ſuch; other ARGUMENTS there are alſo to be drawn from theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>given</hi> &amp; <hi>meaſured,</hi> ſhewing us, that the Rule of our exerciſing the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, is to be taken from the reſpect, as they are from God, and not as inherent in us properly, though ſecondarily, both gifts and graces are to be reſpected and exerciſed therein, as is expreſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>with ſimplicity, with diligence, with cheerfulnes;</hi> and fourthly, from, <hi>to us, v.</hi> 6. <hi>to every one, v.</hi> 3. with the reference of <hi>v.</hi> 6. thereto, ſhewing the ſame, and the ſpecialneſs and ſingularity of the reſpect; but we neither need nor may proſecute every thing to the utmoſt.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170225:56"/>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of Arguments is from ὁ demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively uſed four times, thereby referring us in this point to the matters paſt in the generals, which yeeld ten Arguments as is ſhewn, all ſtrongly, though more obſcurely, proving the ſame diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is here expreſt.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort is from the inference of diſtinct executing of thoſe diſtinct gifts and Offices, upon the former proved, and preſent expreſſed diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, connecting thereby the generalls and particulars, the Root, Body and Branches; the Soul, Body and Members, and the preceding and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent matter of this place incorporatingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo communicating membrally the force of each Argument to the other; the number &amp; weight of the following Arguments are well to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and applyed hereto, after I have alſo anſwered the ſecond Objection from the inſtance in the extraordinary Offices, which now ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
                     <p>To that ſecond Objection; I firſt anſwer, that as thoſe Offices are more hard to know in all the bounds, rules, and appurtenances, and leſs concern us then the ordinary, and alſo yeeld us no preſent light from their practiſe as theſe do, ſo are they leſs diſtinctly known then theſe, and cannot be perfectly paralelled, to make the rules of theſe to ſquare with thoſe, and therefore no good Argument <hi>a notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> can be brought from them againſt our point: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the rule of the extraordinary Offices, was principally according to the being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inabled and directed by God, and not by the ſet State and Office, as the proper ſubject of their gifts, works and end; ſince whoſoever was indued with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170225:56"/> Propheticall, and Evangelicall gifts, did preſently proceed to the execution of thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, without expectation of a farther Ordination, and as being thereby called thereunto; but ſo is it not with the now permanent Offices: Thirdly, thoſe were under the reſpect of Inſtituters, Platformers, and Law, Rule and Worſhip-makers, though <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,</hi> and not as inſtituted after the pattern ſeen in the Mount of the Word, and ſo are not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby, as our inſtituted Offices are. Fourthly, That Order which is to be obſerved in them, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reflex from the Church, to which they moſt properly are given, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>viz.</hi> in their Conſultations, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15.21, 22. and in Ordination, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. &amp; 4.5. then by any ſet Rule in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which yet is ſo <hi>ſparſim</hi> and ſparingly obſerved that it cannot be ſaid to be the Rule of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Offices.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They had divers properly diſtinct functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, works and duties, according to their inſpired abilities, which were ſpecially and ſingularly diſtinct in ſeverall perſons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10, with <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. eſpecially <hi>v.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> diſtributing to every one privately (perſonally, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly, or ſeverally) as he will; and their Offices which came therewith, and thereupon were alike, diſtinct, properly and in kinde.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, For authoritative Offices, which required not only ability, but alſo a ſending or calling unto the Functions, immediate or mediate, about which is the greateſt queſtion; they had alſo and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their diſtinct Functions, Works and Duties alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, either immediately as Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:170225:57"/> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.26.9. with 26.14, to 18. or mediately, deputedly, and inferiorly, as Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.18. &amp; 4.14. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.4.1, 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. to 13. Divers hard queſtions do here ariſe, as, whether <hi>Barnabas</hi> were properly an Apoſtle or no? Whether <hi>Philip</hi> had the ſame authority with <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> and <hi>Titus?</hi> Whether <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had that Authority by <hi>Pauls</hi> deputation, or by their Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall gifts or office? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for theſe I refer thee at this preſent to my four firſt Anſwers, and proceed to the ſeventh.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Neither all, nor any of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Offices, were common in all works, nor ſo only divers in kinde, nor in number, as differing only in gifts, and their exerciſing, which the two oppoſite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions hold, that the three overſeeing ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are: but divers alſo in office, both in name and nature, and therefore the inſtance from them is for neither of them: oppoſite I ſay they are, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves in terms, affection and courſe; and in the two former clauſes of the predicate in kinde, in number, and alſo againſt the ſcope of this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and I think of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. to 9. the ſubject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in matter, affection, and courſe; and in the two latter clauſes of the predicate, in gifts, in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing, though in the latter part of that predicate they be one, and thereby deſtroy the unity and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods Worſhip, giving, yea making way, yea as <hi>Beza Annot.</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. very Divine-like, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly, and it is likely experimentally obſerved, cauſing that great <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> confuſion in the ſame, paſt and preſent, &amp; is to be feared, as he there ſaith, to continue and increaſe, if the cauſe be not taken away; ſo great a matter is it in the judgement of our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170225:57"/> greateſt Divines, howſoever cuſtom and practiſe prevail againſt great and ſmall.</p>
                     <p>Eightly: It doth not appear that any one Office did, or might do the works of all other offices, either extraordinary or ordinary; but the contrary in the former, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.10. to 14.20.25. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Trophimus I left at Miletum ſick,</hi> which muſt needs be at his coming again to the ſame place after his releaſe from his firſt impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> to which alſo the ancient Hiſtories, and Fathers agree in the fact, and is ſo generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though not in the matter of <hi>Trophimus;</hi> ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf neither did nor could do, nor therefore might indeavour to foretell any thing prophetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as of himſelf, or of his office or gift, neither can it be proved that any other Apoſtle might, much leſs any other but the Prophets themſelves: and the latter, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2. where we are to preſume, that the 12. Apoſtles would have prevented the murmuring, &amp; ſupplyed that need both, at leaſt ſo well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeven, if they had done the work of Church-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing, and therefore that they did it not; and alſo if it had been within their charge and office, and that therefore it was not; for that there was need of the work, and alſo of preventing the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring of a great part of the Church, for the not due performance thereof, is expreſt both in terms, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="1">1 The ſimple uſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, confining within, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170225:60"/> prove the point; yet for the eminent clearneſs and ſtrength of theſe proofs, I will connect all the ſorts of them, into which they may ſpecially be divided into one Argument: And firſt, of the firſt five oroot.</p>
                     <p>What diſtinctneſs the <hi>worſhip, will,</hi> and <hi>word of God,</hi> and the fleeing the contraries, do require more peculiarly and ſpecially in the Church-Offices, then are in the civill, that is properly diſtinct in kinde, and very religiouſly to be yeelded to God; but all theſe require more peculiar diſtinctneſs in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, then is in civil Offices, therfore that is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; in kind diſtinct, &amp; very religiouſly to be obſerve</p>
                     <p>Secondly: Of the ſecond five, or body, thus: What diſtinctneſs in the Church Offices is revealed in the Word, to be as the diſtinctneſs of the Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Members of the body, in oppoſition to the oneneſs of the body in kinde, and of the Members in mutuall uſe, and in reſpect of their divers exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Functions, and eſſence, that is moſt proper in kinde, and mutually excluſive; ſuch diſtinctneſs is revealed to be in Eccleſiaſtical Offices: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>

                        </gap>e, and Branches, thus: What Offices are ſaid expreſly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and divers from each other by the diſtinct gift of God; yea, and are there ſo diſtinguiſhed into their ſeveral ſorts, &amp; that both disjunctively, denotative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; apportionedly, or confinedly: thoſe are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in nature, &amp; highly in degree, diſtinct in kind from each other: but the 5 eccleſiaſtical offices are ſo ſaid &amp; diſtinguiſhed, therfore they are moſt properly in nature &amp; highly in degree, diſtinct in kind from each other: Any of theſe 3 connections are alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, yea the 3 laſt Clauſes of the 3 d, do compleatly conclude the point, ſo if any of theſe nineteen Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170225:60"/> bee good, the Eccleſiaſticall Offices are diſtinct in kind, properly &amp; perfectly; yea if the conſequence of none of theſe ſimple or compound Arguments would hold, yet the combination of them all would, which ſhall be the twentieth Argument, and the concluſion of the poſitive proofs of the Point, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. I will now come to the oppoſite part from the Scriptures, referring the proofs from reaſon, both poſitive and oppoſite till after them, and reſerving the other proofs from other places of Scripture, for the better clearing all <hi>Objections,</hi> ſuppoſing the proofs from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. ſufficient to eſtabliſh the Point poſitively.</p>
                     <p>The firſt oppoſite Argument is from <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, 3. thus: The Apoſtles had all offices included in theirs, and did on occaſion execute them, and in particular the Deacons office, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2, 3. therefore the Paſtors now ſo have, and may do. For anſwer whereto, firſt, See what is ſaid before, both againſt the antecedent and its conſequence, and then I think there wil be ſo little appearance of likelyhood, and leſs of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the antecedent, (which is enough) and yet leſs, yea none at all, of either in the conſequence, that none wil require farther diſproof of that, for which it is brought againſt me, and farther wil I not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle therewith here, though it be for me.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. to 8. thus: If ruling and teaching be jointly requiſite to the office of a Biſhop, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. to 8. then are they not the diſtinct functions of two ſeverall Church-offices; but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and teaching are joyntly requiſite to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he office of a Biſhop, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. to 8. therefore they are not the diſtinct functions of the Teacher and Ruler, as they have two ſeverall Church-offices: this is the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170225:61"/> principal, and almoſt the only argument from the Scripture of all 3. ſorts of my Oppoſites, who are as much againſt each other as me, and each will hold with me, rather then with each other; yet muſt I not take notice of their enmity againſt each other, nor me, nor of their frendſhip, but plainly anſwer them all.</p>
                     <p>Of the two groſſer, the former under the name of Biſhop, holding only one in number and nature; the latter holding the three overſeeing Offices, one in kind, &amp; divers only in number, and the more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned acknowledging them divers in kinde and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet differing only in degree and emphaſis: a wonderfull refined diſtinction, in appearance nearer to me, and yet in truth farther from me then the groſſer in appearance; I cannot readily ſay how much, but I can ſee and think it very much, and make ſome uſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>But firſt: For a ioint anſwer to them all, I ſay that, that place intendeth, firſt, no diſtinguiſhing of Offices, but a furniſhing, qualifying and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king worthy of the Churches Offices, the perſons, Officers, and Executors of thoſe Offices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, No inſtituting, nor denotating, as inſtituted, any Church-office: nor, thirdly, any appropriating, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor adaequating any Offices and theit Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the handled place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. doth in all three points; ſo that neither of the two Opinions can challenge either matter or words to be framed and expounded by the ſcope and courſe of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. doth: Neither, fourthly, is there any ſuch ſtrong inducement from the generall body, or ſpeciall, or from any particularizing in the place, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. that we are to expect any of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170225:61"/> them, either expreſly, or by any ſtrong intimation: Fifthly, and more particularly; the ſubject of all the adjuncts is ſet in a generall term, common to three Offices, and therefore no diſtinguiſhing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting, nor appropriating is here intended, for a Biſhop or Overſeer indifferently extendeth it ſelf unto the overſight of the underſtanding, heart and actions in its etymologie, ordinary, yea only uſe and in the correſpondencies with this place; in all but the laſt clauſe there is no doubt: By the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies I intend three places, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. to 13. Secondly, cap. 5.1. to <hi>v.</hi> 18. Thirdly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. to 10. In the laſt, Biſhop and Elder being promiſcuouſly uſed, as in this place; and in the two firſt, Deacons being alſo alike extended, as a Generall to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributer and Pittyer, promiſcuouſly, and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently with helpers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. Neither is that word any where uſed more for the <hi>Diſtributer</hi> then the <hi>Pittyer,</hi> yet once on the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1. for though 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. it be ſaid that a Deacon muſt be the Husband of one Wife, which in word cannot agree with the Widow, yet in the ſcope and general reaſon, which is the ſoul and form of the place, it anſwereth ſo well to her, as to the <hi>Diſtributer, i.e.</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly: For anſwer to the two moſt groſs and oppoſite Objections from this place, I firſt appeal to what is ſaid in and from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Thirdly, I deny the conſequence of the major, ſince <hi>the office of a Biſhop,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. is taken generally, and indifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely by an uſuall metonimy of the particular, and definite for the generall and indefinite, <hi>Biſhop</hi> being a generall, indefinite, and common Name to the three Overſeeing Offices, as a Deacon is to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and an Office or Miniſtry to them both; and alſo as a <hi>Philoſopher, Mathematician, Lawyer, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> eſpecially as an Officer of the State, Law, Courtt, Army, City, or of a Ship, are to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per particulars, yet is there one diviſion of all thoſe Offices, neceſſary to make the exemplification clear and exact, for all thoſe Offices are either overſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſerving, <hi>i. e. Epiſcopall,</hi> or <hi>Diaconall</hi> in the originall Terms, which ſheweth the full reaſon of that certain Propoſition, <hi>whoſoever deſireth the office</hi> (or Miniſtry) <hi>of a Biſhop, deſireth a worthy work:</hi> If yet a farelier reaſon of the Particulars of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of theſe two ſorts of Offices, ſeverally, and of each of their particulars joyntly, be expected,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170225:62"/> it is to be underſtood, that as in God there are three perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, from which all exiſtents &amp; deſignments have their life, moving and being, ſo there are in man natural, eſpecially ſpiritual, three ſubjective and overſeeable faculties, as exiſtent from and by God, <hi>viz.</hi> his wil; wit, affections, or working power; and as many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and overſeeing deſignable Powers and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offices, or deſignments (as before oft and at large) all which require both a joynt and ſeverall qualifying, according to their joyntneſs in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as overſeeing, and ſeverallneſs, in ſpeciall, as ſeverally overſeeing, which is alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the particular qualifyings objected, and in what is hereunto to be ſupplyed, from <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. for their help, if their ground be good, or for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my project, if it be good; ſince therefore Biſhop is a common Name to three Offices; all the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe three are common to it with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs thereupon, following between any of the three Offices, or their Functions, if they be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where diſtinguiſhed and peculiarized.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly: So far as it is intended and inſiſted on, that <hi>the Office of a Biſhop</hi> is a particular, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſtent office; ſo far I deny the minor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire good proof thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: For a particular anſwer to the refined Objectors from this place: I ſay, that though all the <hi>ſyllogiſm</hi> ſhould be granted, yet they get nothing thence for their purpoſe diſtinct from the former o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; and ſo indeed theſe three Opinions are all one, and ſo the laſt is nothing but a pile of witty words, forging a diſtinction without a difference, and ſo it vaniſheth in the fire, like the ſtone, called
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170225:63"/> a Thunder-Bolt, looking-like Silver ore, but is only of a ſulfurious and icie mineral matter, yea though it ſhould be condenſated with ſome of the Clay of Antichriſts Legs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. even by ſaying that the Biſhop, Paſtor, Elder, and Exhorter, are all one Office, called by divers names for divers reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhop, as Overſeer of Overſeers; Paſtor, by an emphaſis, as the chief feeder, and exhorter: El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in reſpect of his yeers, gravity, wiſdom, and perſonal fitneſs to rule, as the proper reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is all of the reſt; and this ſurely is that ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Eſau</hi> not yet come to the birth in our Church, though it be at leaſt that reviling <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> his younger brother, with whom I am neither occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor enabled to fight; but will only proſecute my preſent object occaſioned; anwering more particularly,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That if it ſhould be granted that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horter, or Teacher, or both, by a community of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, through this community of actions objected, could do all that I have appropriated to the Ruler; yet by the ſame community of actions, the Ruler may do the like for them, and then though they ſhould ſhuffle down Gods miniſterial bounds, they would get nothing, except the Rulers wife be better than the others, which ſurely they will not ſay.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if they will uſurp the appropriation of the Biſhoprick from the Ruler, or the Exhorter from them both (as reaſon and experience give us to ſuſpect,) yea, and of all power in the Church, which now they grant them upon the eminent and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reaſons mentioned; they build ſuch forces for <hi>Hierarch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe three oppoſite Opinions are ſo neer each other in truth, (though in courſe and affection vehemently adverſe) that I cannot cut down the one, but the other two wither alſo: ſo that all the Arguments ſeem alike againſt all, and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a kind of confuſion in them, as in the Oppoſites: and <hi>ergo</hi> in the following Arguments I will refer the ſorting to the Reader, whether it be from one, two, or all three of the Objections. The firſt unſorted Argument is from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8, 12. which prove, that the ſame may be ſaid of the Deacons, which they ſay of Biſhops or Elders, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one in number, or as divers in number; and alſo in gifts or emphaſis: but all three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the caſe otherwiſe in the Deacons: The firſt, in that the Diſtributer, and Pittier, or Widow, are as divers, as I hold the three Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers. The ſecond, in that there were 7. of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. the 3. <hi>ergo</hi> much more than either.

                     <p>The third is from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. Firſt, becauſe the Ruler is by expreſs denotation, and place of ſtate, diſtinguiſhed from the Labourer in the Word; by the denotative Article <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The third oppoſite Argument, is from <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. in that they are all called Biſhops, or

                     <p>The laſt Objection is from Reaſon, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to croſs that diſtinctneſs we ſtand for; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through the uncapableneſs of the matter; and partly, through the miſchiefs which enſue the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170225:67"/> ſame. The former part of this Objection ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth colourable, becauſe Teaching, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to what is taught, worketh no grace in the heart, but onely the Theory thereof in the head. Exhortation, without Teaching, worketh no true Chriſtian grace, but blind, ſuperſtitious, and Antichriſtian Devotion; either, and both, are externally fruitleſs, without Ruling; and Ruling without both is internally barren: ſo that the 2d. end of Gods Worſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> our Holineſs, is defeated thereby. For this, we are firſt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this caſe in the right and compleat Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Worſhip; and then in the growing eſtate thereof; in the mans and adult eſtate thereof, wherein all things are grown to a ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it may well be cleared; for when all the Offices are conſtituted in their Purity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in ſincerity, we are to ſuppoſe the Rule of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. to be obſerved; which requireth, that all Gods Ordinances be done comelyly, and in order. Now, if in the exerciſe of each Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Purity be obſerved, both in comelyneſs, as reſpecting it ſelf, not excluding the Order of combination with others: and in order with the reſt, yet preſerving decorum in it ſelf; and alſo Sincerity in all ſanctified peculiar and ſociall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, according to the Light of Nature, and the Word: then ought the Labourers in the Word, ſo to aſſociate their Converſation and Studies in the Week-days, and Miniſtries on the Lords day, that the Exhorter is to know (at leaſt) the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that the Teacher will gather out of the part of the Word to be handled, whether by their own diſpoſing, or publike Order: and that he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170225:67"/> therefore will build upon the Foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by laid for him, by the Teachers Grammaticall, Rhetorical, and Logical Expoſition and Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divine Doctrines, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h poſitive and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite with their Proofs and Illuſtrations, Marks and Means; yea, all things pre-requiſite to Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Then alſo ought the whole Company of overſeeing Officers to be acquainted with the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of exerciſing the Ruling-Office, that the Teacher may the better be provided with matter of Information and Confutation, and the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Exhortation and Dehortation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may the better diſpoſe of his manner of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and cenſuring; and each again with the ſum of the others purpoſes, that each may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſuit with the others courſes; for in each of theſe three Offices eſpecially, there are two eſſential properties which have both a peculiar and a ſocial reſpect: the one extenſive, quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, material, and inſtitutive, <hi>viz.</hi> the apportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and adequating the Offices and their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as the Teacher, and his Teaching, &amp;c. The other intenſive, qualitative, formal, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>viz.</hi> the adaptating or ſuiting the Officers and their Offices, as the Teacher, and his knowledge and ability to reach, the Exhorter, &amp;c. as before in the Table at large, and it's Epitome: In the former, is the purity of the Offices, and God's Worſhip, to be diſcerned: In the latter, is the ſincerity of the Officers and Worſhippers to be tryed. Alſo, in the peculiar reſpects of both, the godlyneſs, or fixt link of <hi>Peter</hi>'s golden Chain of Election and Salvation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. is required to be exerciſed: and in the ſociall or mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170225:68"/> the brotherly kindneſs or 7th. link is called for. Now, all the ſervices of God being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and exerciſed in their purity compleatly, and all his ſervants therein practiſing all ſincerity, there is no diſſonancie, much leſſe impoſſibility in this diſtinctneſs of the Church-Offices: But if there be a failing in this purity, compleatneſs, and ſincerity, or in either of them, then there muſt be much of the matter of the Objection granted, and will be more appearing, which is the ſecond conſideration of the former part of the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To which I anſwer: Firſt, that I intend not at all to pacifie the fury of Hierarchians, by pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating this matter in any reſpect toward them, among whom all the Order of God's Worſhip, is deviſed by Antichriſt, and ſo made in appearance Chriſtian, but in true underſtanding is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>i. e.</hi> diverſe from, and oppoſite to Chriſtian; for the order thereof is Babyloniſh, diſorderly, and confuſed, in reſpect of Gods order in his Word, though to the Spirit of the World, it ſeemeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea onely uniform and orderly in Nature, and in it ſelf; yea, and thereby the parts of God's Worſhip are perverted, and ſubordinate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperiour or end, and ſo loſe their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at leaſt, in reſpect of the Conſciences of the Uſers, which is to be eſteemed according to the intention of the principal and predominant Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor and Author of the Work and Worſhip it ſelf; and therefore it were great folly to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to conſonate the Order of Chriſts Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto Antichriſts, as it is to make good Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick on an Inſtrument put wholly out of Tune; and therefore I leave the Mother of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170225:68"/> Daughter of <hi>England,</hi> to their folly and fury in this caſe, wherein I cannot prevent them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that though I will yield much to the weakneſs of the exerciſe of the Order of God's Worſhip in the preſent Reformed Churches, and will endeavour to ſhew, that this diſtinctneſs is, and may be obſerved in them: yet if men be not ſatisfied therewith, I will not yield, that the Rule is to be framed according to the preſent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but that to the Rule of God's Word; and if excuſes be made, that all things cannot by them be eſtabliſhed, according to the perfect Rule, both through the hinderance of the otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Magiſtracy, and for the want of fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or perſons thereto qualified, and maintenance for them, if they be to be had: Firſt, let not Pleaders of extenuations, no nor of excuſes, be Judgers of that Law, from the breach whereof they excuſe themſelves; for that were more then childiſh pettulancy, even to bite and whine: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though indeed they be excuſes from all fault, yet cenſures for diſſonancy are not ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, till things are in their compleat and adult eſtate; for as exactneſs is not to be required from, ſo alſo not by a child under Age and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors until he come to his mans eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for the matter, though one or two of the Offices be wanting; yet may the two or one remaining, conveniently agree with this diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the onely ſeeming otherwiſe, is between the Labourers in the Word, eſpecially in the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who, without Doctrines before laid, proved and cleered, cannot exhort to the obſervation of them.</p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:170225:69"/>
                     <p>To this I have anſwered before, to which I refer thee; adding onely, that though in the caſe of neceſſity, and without which, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation cannot be, it be lawful, yea neceſſary for the Exhorter to Teach: yet without thoſe caſes, and where there is a Teacher, that doth his duty; yea, and where there is equally neceſſary matter of Exhortation, received as true by the Church, it is not lawfull, much leſs his bounden duty, to teach the Theory of Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the Teacher, there is no neceſſity of not teaching, though there be neither Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation nor Ruling, to bring it's Teaching to its more powerful and plentiful effect; and <hi>ergo</hi> the ſame reaſon warranteth him, not to exhort or rule in any expreſs, plain, and known act, though he be not forbidden all manner of acts that are horta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or ruling ſo abſolutely; as Murder, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Robbery, or the like: but there is a Brotherly Fellowly, and mutual freeneſs, and friendly boldneſs to be preſumed on and allowed; yea, in ſome occaſionall acts, even to the danger of Uſurpation, if thoſe acts ſhould be conſtantly and functionally uſed: As for the Ruler, none plead for his adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which are Appendices to Teaching and Exhorting, and Signs and Seals of the ſame things, to the other Senſes, which they ſpeak to the Ears, or rather through them all, to the Underſtanding and Heart: but thoſe that hold them one Office, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divers names, who are not the Objectors of theſe Inconveniencies; and therefore I need ſay nothing againſt the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, though matter of conveniency and inconveniency, pertaineth properly to Wiſdome, and not to Duty, and is but a little better then Humane Authority: yet ſince it is ſo eſteemed, and inſiſted on by many, I will put the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of the diſtinctneſs I ſtand for, into the other ballance, both for the cleer confutation of this Argument, and proving the point by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits thereof, if any ſuch proof be therein, as men account; and I grant, in reſpect of the Wiſdome of God, if the matter be clearly ſhewn, though as a proper and original Argument, which is onely from the Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. I dare not obtrude it, but onely in the reſpects mentioned, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, and as a retorted, plauſible, and probable Argument: Now the Name and Nature of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies lead us to conſider of the anſwering reſpects of theſe Offices, which are, 6. <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, the Church, each other, eaches ſeveral work, the Lords of the Gentiles, and Antichriſt. Chriſt is the Monarch, Head, Law-giver, and Maſter of his Church, <hi>ergo</hi> it is fit that he alone ſhould be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Primitive; and that each Office of his Church ſhould be derived out of his Primacy, and none others; elſe ſhould the derived have another Lord and Maſter than Chriſt, for which no ordinary perſon is fit in any reſpect, though extraordinary perſons by Gifts and Functions, immediate as Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and Prophets, and by Offices made types of Chriſt by the Word, were; and alſo ordinary Corporations, which are of an higher nature than any perſon, but no man than any other; which is the reaſon, that in Common-wealths, that are moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170225:70"/> governed, no Ruler may depute a Deputy-Ruler under him; though, where the conſtitution of the Common-wealth is otherwiſe, it be lawfull to depute, to be deputed, and to ſubmit to either: yet our preſent point is, Whether Deputation and Superiority of Church-Officers be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in reſpect of Chriſt, than equality between them. Secondly, for confuſion of the three Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Functions, whether it be more convenient in reſpect of Chriſt, than their diſtinctneſs, which the three anſwering, yea primitive reſpects of Chriſt, as God, Man, and Mediatour, before paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled, do evidently clear, <hi>viz.</hi> that equality and diſtinctneſs are more convenient.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Church is the Baſis, End, and Owner of the Miniſters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9, 10, 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. all, eſpecially <hi>v.</hi> 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. &amp; therefore is it moſt fit that it ſhould have the deputing and diſtinguiſhing them, and not any ones Authority, in the former, or diſcretion in the latter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, though a diſparity ſhould be granted, which of them ſhould have the Superiority? Surely the Paſtour: Why? becauſe his Office is to ſeed the whole Flock, and ſo the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Now <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſignifieth alſo to rule, and ſo he is to feed by Ruling: There is no fear of this Argument, except the Arguer be made curſt by Antichriſtian hands and breath, at his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cuſtome in his Practiſe; and alſo long horned by Authority, Reputation, and Gifts: and yet then, God is more to be ſeared, and his Truth more to be regarded, than our Skin, and he to be anſwered: Firſt, that that name is common to all the <hi>Three,</hi> ſo well as Biſhops and Elders; as is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170225:70"/> plain by <hi>Act.</hi> 20. where <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to ſend for the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and charge them to feed (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) the Flock, whereof the Holy Ghoſt had made them Biſhops: Why therefore doth he not claim the name &amp; nature of Biſhop and Elder ſo well as of Paſtor? that all the World, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. do give him: What the Word, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. doth give him, I will reverendly conſider: but what all the World doth, I regard not, leſt I ſhould be little regarded by Chriſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.1. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. nameth Paſtours: but, firſt, the drift thereof is, to declare, that the Spiritual Offices were all given by Chriſt as a tryumphant King; but neither to conſtitute, nor diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he firſt ſheweth, that the principall Offices, <hi>viz. The feeding,</hi> were ſo given by him; and then, that the principal of them, in reſpect of Gifts, and extraordinary need, through its leaſt ſupply from Nature (which is the <hi>unum</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſcope of that place, <hi>viz. The Teachers,</hi> were ſo alſo, Whether you take Teaching generally, for Labouring in the Word: as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. doth; or ſtrictly, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. Under which, two terms are compendiouſly comprehended, the leſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Offices alſo, <hi>a majori;</hi> for if he gave the chief Offices or Gifts, whether in a generall, or particular regard: he both would and could, much more give the ſecondary alſo.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all the Offices are not there reckoned, either generally, ſynedochically, nor particularly, but as I have ſaid; for no mention is made of the ſerving offices at all otherwiſe, therefore there can thence no exact particularizing of the Church-offices be concluded, but ſuch as is ſupplyed out
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170225:71"/> of other places. Secondly, for their Unity in kind, if it ſhould be ſuppoſed, yet why may the Paſtour (as he is called) more excommunicate, than the Ruler adminiſter the Sacraments? which is the main of the Controverſie. No anſwer hath been given me herein, though I have oft and inſtantly demanded it; neither know I any, and therefore I muſt conclude, that the Exhorter cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Ruling-power, claimed by the right of the Word, or Reaſon, from that exaltation above, or confuſion with the other overſeeing Offices, which is pretended; nor by any other, but Babyloniſh; becauſe his Collegues will not, nay may no, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch yet in the third place I deny him, for the Reaſons before-mentioned; and alſo, leſt he oppreſs them, if he be of that Spirit, and eminently gifted, or be oppreſſed by the inequality of his work, if he be equally gifted, and modeſtly ſpirited, which will the better be diſcerned in the proſecuting the fourth ſort of Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi> which ariſe from peculiar and diſtinct reſpects of each office, which now ſucceedeth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, as every Officer is immediate from the Church; ſo is it convenient, 1. That his Functions and Actions ſhould be aſſigned him from the ſame, and not by the diverſe perſonall abilities of the other officers; for elſe doth he not walk in the particular aſſignment of the Church diſpoſed to him, according to his gifts; but in his own, allotted him by his own diſcretion, or of his Collegues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That his Authority of diſcharge, of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her four; the Ruler, to order the reſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, and to execute the determinations of the Church toward the other four; and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to ſhew mercy to the reſt; beſides, their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to themſelves, and the whole Church, in their joynt Authoritative Actions, and their ſeverall ſanctified Converſations; and alſo toward the Prophets in their Exerciſe: both wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confute both their Superiority and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another Argument againſt the former parts of this fourth ſort, is, that elſe none were fit to be an Exhorter, except he were firſt enabled to every office.</p>
                     <p>And a fourth, that a man were fit to be of one of the other offices, if there be an Exhorter eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, though he be but half fit thereto, ſimply and without that ſuppoſition, which four diſtinct perſonal, and peculiar reſpects, prove, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horter hath not all offices included in his.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, againſt the latter part, <hi>viz.</hi> the undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs: Firſt, elſe there ſhould be no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs between the three over-ſeeing offices, than between the particulars of each of them, and between the Deacons; yea, the Prophets: I will inſtance in the Deacons, one of them is fitter then the reſt to hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hes ſeverall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This, for the preſent, being ſuppoſed, ſhall we thereupon conclude, that theſe are five, or moe diſtinct ſerving offices: Surely, he were unfit for the meaneſt of the five, and much more for any of the three over-ſeeing offices, that ſhould ſo judge, except he could find where the Word did diſtinguiſh them; and if he could, then were it as great weakneſs to hold them but one office in kind: and yet greater, ſo holding, to hold alſo that they may promiſcuouſly execute each others Function, whereby they are found and held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; but moſt of all, to lay it as a general rule, that they may ſo execute: and yet to exempt the Paſtour onely from the ſame, without giving a peculiar reaſon therefore. The like and greater intricateneſs and diſtraction is in our caſe, becauſe it is evident in the Word, that there is ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs, in kind, to be found and held. Now, if there be but one Office in kind, as the Deacons, then is every one charged with every over-ſeeing action by God, and no mutual agreement, nor Church-aſſignment can excuſe any one, if any one overſeeing action be wholly omitted: But on the other ſide, if they be three in kind, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly aſſigned by the Word, the one is excuſed,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170225:72"/> though the other fail, either in being, or well-being: nay, he ſhould as much fail as <hi>Vzzah,</hi> if he ſhould ſupply the failing office, through the affinitive of his office, or perſonal devotion. But in the third place, (to conclude at laſt) to be put to hold and practiſe both, is to be put into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable intricateneſs, and labyrinth, without light or clue, to help him out, or to work within it; which is more then ever God charged upon man, or man could diſcharge unto God; yea, if they be flat contradictories, as they ſeem, more then God can diſcharge, for he cannot lie, and then he can charge, for he cannot oppreſs: Let not us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give or take an higher office, nor harder work, then God himſelf will either give or take to himſelf, or any other. The like may be ſaid of the Deacons and Widows, and both may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by the legal and preſent joynt practiſes, <hi>Numb</hi> 3. and 18. and very oft in poſitive and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite reſpects.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, and ſecondly, it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 30. that God hath given ſome to be Teachers, and ſome other Governours, and not Teachers, and ſo on the contrary; the ſcope of the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew, that excellency, above others, cannot be had in the offices of the Church, becauſe they are ſeverally diſtributed by God, and not divers to one perſon; as is before fully proved.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon, if a man ſhould frame his practiſe in any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I might have added other Arguments againſt the firſt Opinion, that all Offices are in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. The former place ſhewing the end of Chriſts diſtribution of the Offices, to be, to profit the Church, and not to magnifie any Officer: But that his end, is to magnifie the Paſtour above the reſt, and ſo that the diſtinction ſhould be as great, or greater, then the former two: and the latter places, ſhewing the fift Office to be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and not a mans, and ſo unfit for the Paſtour to diſcharge; as becauſe her office is night and day to attend the Sick, both men and women: But I leave them for you to proſecute, by your own meditations, ſuppoſing the other fully ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>

                     <p>THE ſcope of <hi>Rome,</hi> 12.1. to 8. is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet ſummarily, to deſcribe, teach, and effectually to charge the matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods inſtituted Worſhip; as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 1. in the general, and <hi>v.</hi> 6. in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: Thoſe two Verſes are alſo expreſly connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by cauſal and illative Conjunctions, which are the abſoluteſt Connecters of the Connection of <hi>v.</hi> 4. with 5th. and 7th. with 6th. and 8th. with 7th. there can be no doubt. Now, the ſoul and ſinews being of the ſame body, the fleſh and bones cannot but be granted, to be of the ſame alſo: neither is the encorporatedneſs of theſe 8. Verſes onely literall, but eſpecially reall, each without other being maimed, and all joyntly yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an excellent deſcription and charge of Gods
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170225:75"/> Worſhip; the Root, in <hi>v.</hi> 7. and 2. giving life to the body in <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5. and to the branches, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. the body giving ſuſtenance and ſuſtentation with the Root to the Branches, and the Branches ſhewing the Heavenly Fruit of both. Let the words be obſervantly read, and a ſenſe worthy the Scripture be conceived; and the matter being the ſame with the ſecond Commandement, and yet being very imperfectly delivered, but in this place, and here alſo in the common ſenſe: and I cannot but think, that the Underſtanding and Ingenuous will find an admirable conciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a large matter, a clearneſs in this dark and ſ ecial point of the Word, yea, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs in what is moſt harſh to Nature, as being not onely above it, but mainly intended to thwart it, and to proclaim and conſtrain God's abſolute Will to be ſubmitted unto, as to the Lord and Ruler of all; the Fall alſo of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the moſt abominable ſinnes ever ſince, were there-againſt, and all deſolations thereout, and the yet prevailing Antichriſtian ſinne, aſſiſting in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſs thereto, and uſurpation thereover.</p>
                     <p>The drift therefore of the Holy Ghoſt being herein to preach and preſs preciſeneſs in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and diſtinctneſs in the manner of God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Worſhip: The latter of this place, and the reſt of this ſubject, muſt have their ſpirit from hence; which alſo, will not onely eaſily, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſort therewith, and better than with any other; and though the manner or order of any thing cannot be ſhewn, but upon ſuppoſition of the matter known, or in the ſhewing to be withall made known: yet when the Apoſtle
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170225:75"/> cometh, <hi>v.</hi> 6. to aſſume and conclude his intent in the premiſſes, <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 5. he ſeemeth to have ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and intended onely the diſtinctneſs of the Church ſtates, by their peculiar Functions, and the order of exerciſing them in the Church Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; onely in the handling, <hi>Paul,</hi> after the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Scripture-manner, interlaceth the peculiar vertues of three of the Offices, which were hardeſt to be known, leaving the other two eaſier to be by the like courſe underſtood, as on the other ſide, he expreſſeth his main drift of charging the diſtinctneſs of the Offices, and their Functions, onely in the two firſt, leaving the like to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the other three; ſo that it is expreſly proved, that the Offices are diſtinct, <hi>v.</hi> 6. which after are expreſſed to be five. In the Inference therefore of <hi>v.</hi> 6. is the drift of the Holy Ghoſt expreſſed, which is the Soul and Life of the whole Context: upon it, therefore, we are to ſtand as we uſe to do, on the parting of the Branches from the Body of the Tree; for the beſt finding and gathering the Fruit of the Tree, whereby the Nature of the Tree, and Intent of the Planter is beſt to be diſcerned; that therefore ſaith, <hi>We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then gifts</hi> (or ſince then we have gifts) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace</hi> (meaſure of Faith, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>that is given,</hi> (meaſured <hi>v.</hi> 3.) <hi>different,</hi> (divers or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct) <hi>whether it be Propheſie</hi> (the eſtate or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Church-Prophet, or both): <hi>according to the proportion</hi> (meaſure <hi>v.</hi> 3. gift <hi>v.</hi> 6.) <hi>of Faith</hi> (grace <hi>v.</hi> 6.) 2. Of the Intereſt in Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. or Worſhip and Will of God, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.) He ſeemeth to have left the ſpeech very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; yet therein he moſt excellently perfecteth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170225:76"/> the drift of the Holy Ghoſt affirmed; that is, to prove a diſtinct obſervance in the offices, and not to provoke unto vehemency in the execution, which will undoubtedly follow this diſtinct diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpeciall intent of Gods zealous and jealous diſtinguiſhing them. Secondly, it ſuiteth with the ten times greater care that is taken throughout the Scriptures, that Gods Worſhip ſhould be obſerved according to his Precepts, Statutes, or Inſtitutions, or Laws; and Zeal that is uſed, in the reproof of the contrary, than that a zealous Worſhip ſhould be given him. Thirdly, he therein well obſerveth the order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, in more regarding the ſecond then the third. And fourthly, the order of Nature, which firſt, and more regardeth the truth of the matter then the meaſure. And fiftly, his own ſcope, intimated in the five former verſes, and oft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, to take care for Gods Worſhip of his Word, <hi>v.</hi> 1. of his Will, <hi>v.</hi> 2. of his apportioning, <hi>v.</hi> 3. of his diſpoſing, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. of his divers giving, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and of his exact diſtinguiſhing, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. more than for the meaſure thereof. Sixthly, he well preferreth the maine of the matter, before the exactneſs of words, yea than competency: but in this caſe of endangering the proper ſcope of the place, which would have been the eaſier wreſted, to the provoking and ſtirring up the gifts and powers, had there been the leaſt word of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or exhortation expreſſed; and therein ſome way ſhould ſeem to have been given to the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh confuſion of Gods Worſhip, currant in the World for the true; yea, the zeal for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip eſtabliſhed, mixed with the acuteneſs and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170225:76"/> violentneſs of the intereſſed therein, would have made it ſeem, that it had made way for the ſame: but the Holy Ghoſt would not give them ſo much cloak for their ſinne, and deceit of the weak: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know I what other pretence of the ſcope of this place can yield to any kind of audaciouſneſs of Conſcience herein. Seventhly, he could not have perfected that verſe, (nor <hi>v.</hi> 7. nor 8.) but he muſt have endangered the other, and ſo the whole, in ſome meaſure; at leaſt, if the phraſe which is as the Charret-man of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould have failed in this ſore-front of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the fearful and far-of, would firſt have ſhrunk, and then the next would have followed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and ſo the reſt muſt have been overcome by violence; which was the caſe of <hi>Darius Codo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> and the reputed Cauſe of the tranſlating of the Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Grecians:</hi> But the All-ſeeing Wiſdome better provided for his Charret-man in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This, therefore, is a ſecond Argument, that the ſcope of the place, is to teach the diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Offices,</hi> and their <hi>Functions,</hi> in that this ſixt verſe is left ſo extreamly imperfect, and no other good reaſon being for it, but to prevent evaſion there-from; for though it be ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Let us propheſie;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Let him wait on;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Let him do it:</hi> yet there is not a word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Original, but the Tranſlators have taken liberty to inſert them all, becauſe to them there ſeemed otherwiſe no ſenſe; whereas they have thereby made new Scripture of their own, yea contrary to the intent of the Holy Ghoſt, if they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170225:77"/> and their Readers intend any Exhortation to the Acts of Propheſie, Miniſtration, Diſtribution, with Simplicity, &amp;c. or to vehemency in any of them, or to any thing, but the preciſe obſervance of Gods allotment committed to them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as the firſt Argument proveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to charge the diſtinctneſs, and the ſecond to prevent all evaſions there-from: ſo doth the exact Analyſis of all Church-States, and their Functions in the matter preceding, ſecond both therein.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>ver.</hi> 4, and 5. we are to obſerve; firſt the poſitive part, and then their oppoſite; and in the former, their Fabrick it ſelf, and its uſe and end: their Fabrick is a body, with its members and their works: the end thereof, is the entire good of the body, and each part thereof: the other ends thereof are proper to the relation of theſe verſes with the three former, and three ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The Fabrick it ſelf is two-fold, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Spiritual:</hi> the former is ſet by the Holy Ghoſt here, as the Protaſis and Pattern of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the latter, as the Apodoſis and reflex of the former; not as a bare ſimile or alluſion, but as ſuch a neceſſited and compleat Directory and Pattern of Divine Evangelical Worſhip; as the Pattern ſeen by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount was unto him for the Tabernacle, and all things thereof, and the Pattern left by <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> was to him for the Temple, and all things of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and both for the main Warrant of the Legall Worſhip; ſo is the Protaſis here ſaid to be the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and thereby made the Warrant of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical worſhip: a diſtinct and intent view therefore is to be taken of this Divine Exemplar, that our

                     <p>The 44. is from <hi>each in particular:</hi> In relation to one body, That there is an expreſs difference between the Church-members relation to the Church, and to each other: ſo that the 45.

                     <p>The 53. is from <hi>diſtinct:</hi> That the precedent general ſcope, was to ſhew, that the Church-Eſtates are diſtinct in their Inſtitution, and ſo to be obſerved in their uſe; and the 54. that <hi>the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſcope is to particularize that diſtinctneſs.</hi>

                     <p>Hitherto of the generals of true Worſhip in its parts, order, and ornaments: The ſpeciall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars thereof follow; whence the reſt are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to be deduced.</p>

                     <p>The 62. is from <hi>Whether,</hi> Not both, as, or even; <hi>That the exacteſt diſtinctive terms are to be uſed in the diſtinctneſs of the Church-Eſtates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 63. is from <hi>Propheſie:</hi> That the ability of any member to propheſie, enſtateth and enright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to the Exerciſe of Propheſie. And the 64. referred to <hi>or an Office,</hi> That Perſonall and Miniſterial Eſtates are to be kept diſtinct: And the 65. referred to <hi>Teaching,</hi> and <hi>Exhorting</hi> (part of the Function of the Prophets) that membrall and Miniſterial Eſtates are diſtinct, and ſo to be kept even in the ſame works, <hi>i. e.</hi> in their reſpects, cauſes, and degrees.</p>
                     <p>The 66. is from the placing <hi>according to the proportion of Faith,</hi> after <hi>whether Propheſie;</hi> though without thoſe words there is onely the form of an inference without any thing inferred, That <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is true or good in the generals, is ſo alſo in the particulars:</hi> And the 67. from the ſame reaſon of annexing them to all and every of the other particulars, That <hi>the exact proportion between our Church-Offices, and their Functions, is to be kept;</hi> and yet more particularly referred to the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.

                     <p>The firſt Church-eſtate is of Infants, and ſuch as are not of Diſcretion, Reaſon, and Knowledge, to diſcern the Lords body, and acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: yet are they true members of the Church, enrighted thereby to receive the ſeale thereof, and its priviledges.</p>

                     <p>Theſe are the integral parts of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of the Organicall, is the Teacher, whoſe Miniſteriall Office is Miniſterially to teach, inform, prove, diſprove, and adminiſter the Teaching Seals for knowledge.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the Exhorter, whoſe inſtituted office is to exhort, dehort, comfort, reprove, and terrifie, by the preaching the Word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, as Seals thereof, unto the Sanctification of the Church.</p>

                     <p>The firſt three of theſe Offices are called by one common name of Biſhops, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. becauſe their Office is ſet to overſee, take care and charge of the Church in all Spirituall means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, grace, and honeſt behaviour, for the benefit of the Church thereby.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are Feeders, Shepherds, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28, for their duty to feed, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and phyſick the Church, by all means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, reformation, and preſervation ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, for its benefit thereby.</p>

                     <p>Theſe are the nine ſorts of Church-members, Portions, Proportions, Gifts, and Graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. to 6. enrighted there by to receive the benefits of Chriſt, and do his ſpeciall works allotted to his Church, for his ſpeciall worſhip, and their good.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170225:84"/>
                     <p>The firſt four as children, women, men, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, have by their Church-memberſhip an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Perſonal Saintſhip, of publike right to the duty and benefits of Divine Worſhip, the ſecond Commandement, and the ſecond Petition for their grace and exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>The laſt five, as Church-officers, have a farther priviledge and duty by their inſtituted offices, to purchaſe a good degree in the Faith, and to be promoted to an higher work, and ſo to expect a greater bleſſing here and hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the particulars of the reall parts of Divine Worſhip, &amp;c. and their ſubſequents; the immediate previal thereof, is the power of the Church ſanctified by the Word of the Apoſtles of the Chriſt of God, to enright thoſe eſtates in thoſe works for thoſe ends.</p>
                     <p>The immediate previal cauſe of the firſt four is the actuated Covenant of the Saints to be a Church, whereby they are made members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therewith enrighted to receive, and do their diſtinct works unto thoſe benefits.</p>
                     <p>But of the laſt five, it is the Church-power ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and ordaining them into thoſe Offices, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righting them to thoſe adminiſtrations for the Churches, and their own edification, exhortation, and comfort, and for Gods Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Therein are two doubts, whether Election or Ordination be the proper and predominant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming cauſe?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But Church-Election is the procreating act in the Spirituall Nature of things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Giving the Office and Right.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To adminiſter.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:170225:85"/>4. To God and the Church.</p>
                     <p>For Ordination is onely a Miniſterial, and no immediate and proper Church-action: but one Miniſter hath no power ſanctified by God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create another as under the Law, but is onely as the Midwife to help in the birth of that office, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Church-election (according to the expreſs pattern of the Church, its Power, Offices, and their choice and working, ſet <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. to 8.) createth, giveth right &amp; charge unto the Officers elected to work for the <hi>Church;</hi> but Ordination is onely a neceſſited act appointed by the body to manifeſt and compleat its choiſe by ſome cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall act inſtituted to that end, without any reall or arbitrary Power in the Ordainer, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond doubt is, Whether the conſent of the choſen be eſſentially requiſite; but it is onely by conveniency, and for the <hi>bene eſſe;</hi> the efficient Power being in the Church to chuſe its Officers, &amp;c. but not to contract.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperiour and remote previals, and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſes efficient, material, formal, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, are many; but the chief are mentioned already.</p>
                     <p>The Uſes are firſt in the generall of all the parts to obſerve their concordance in one Root, even the Church; from which they receive their Being, Life, and Power: The four firſt by their admiſſion: The five laſt by their Election, to do and receive good.</p>
                     <p>Then their agreement with each other in thei fraternity and portions; Children having the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170225:85"/> ſame Church-memberſhip with the other 8; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the ſame right with the laſt 7, to the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer; Men the right to Church-power, with the laſt 6; and Prophets ſo true a right to ſpeak in the Church, to the edification, exhortation, and comfort thereof, as the three ſorts of Biſhops, Paſtours, and Elders; though not with the like meaſure, charge, authority, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Likewiſe, the Teacher hath charge and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all, both integral and miniſterial members, in matters of knowledge, proof, diſproof, and motives to knowledge: The Exhorter, over all in matters of Exhortation, Comfort, and their Oppoſites: The Ruler in matters of order and government. Alſo, the Diſtributer hath charge to ſerve all Church-members in matters of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and help in Church-ſervices; and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in matters of preſervation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerve their ſpeciall diſtinctneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their diverſity of gifts, graces, and proportions, commanded <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 6, 7, 8. to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the Church in particular.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The Women not to meddle with any kind of authority, order, or power, their inferiority of Sex diſ-inabling them therein, by a naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion thereto.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. The Prophets alſo are not to ſpeak Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially with authority, charge, threats, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; but onely with ſtrengh of arguments, brotherly perſwaſions and motives, and leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and large then the Miniſters; and alſo in their diſtinct courſe, place, and time.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Teacher alſo is not to preſs Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Comforts, &amp; their contraries, on the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hearts in purpoſes of practiſe, but to leave them diſtinct for the Exhorter: neither is he to exerciſe any work of government.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. No, nor the Exhorter, but as actually depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church, in caſe of abſence of a Ruler, but in which caſe, neither of them are to admit, excommunicate, ordain, degrade members nor officers, nor order the Church-exerciſes.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170225:91"/> themſelves firſt, Propheſie is Gods Ordinance to gifted perſons; a membral ſpeaking by two or three in the Church to edification, exhortation, and comfort of all the Church: all but membral is expreſſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3, 4, 5, 12, 19, 24. and that at leaſt is to be underſtood, in that it is written to a Church: and <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>a woman is forbidden to ſpeak in the Church,</hi> in handling this Exerciſe: Now none hath power or priviledge in the Church, or its Exerciſes, but Church-members; and that at the leaſt, in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, with 7. it is expreſly diſtinct from a Miniſtry: indeed, able gifts are neceſſary, and as neceſſarily to be underſtood, in <hi>ſpeaking to Edification, Exhortation, and Comfort;</hi> for without them, none can ſo do, and ſo is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be expreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From this definition ariſe theſe points: firſt, all members of Churches that can ſpeak to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Exhortation, and comfort of the Church, may, and ought to do it, in the exerciſe of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Onely ſuch, and ſuch may.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Officers of the Church as ſuch, except the Ruler ih his ordering the action, have intereſt in Propheſie above other members; but in priority of order, and betterneſs of gifts, the former giveth onely firſtneſs in the courſe agreed on by the Prophets: the latter onely more length of time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Church (or Rulers) as ſuch, hath no more authority to preſcribe the Doctrines and Texts to the Prophets, then to the Miniſters of the Word, the Teacher and Exhorter; but rather leſs in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Firſt, becauſe the Miniſters have right and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170225:91"/> charge from the Deputation of the Church, but the Prophets not ſo; but their memberſhip they have by and with their Original Church-ſtate, and not by any derivation there-from, and their gifts from their perſons. Secondly, becauſe the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to be ſuppoſed enabled to all Texts and Doctrines, and the Church may more colourably require what Text and Doctrine they think beſt for them; but the Prophets not ſo, but are truly ſuch, though enabled but in ſome Texts and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrnes; and ſo both in regard of their eſtates and abilities.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The number and order of the Speakers, are to be by the agreement of the Prophets themſelvs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. to 33. The Miniſters, as Members and Prophets, having but the priority and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech in the agreement and exerciſe, and that onely by the light of nature, giving more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the more honourable in eſtate and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but giving no Eccleſiaſtical ſuperiority in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: the confuſion of which two eſtates ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have been the firſt Seed of, and ſtep to Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A diſtinct place for the Speakers in each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, is to be deſigned by the Prophets, or by thoſe that deſign other Seats, fit to ſpeak out of, and to be heard and ſeen by all, which ſeemeth to be before the Elders Pue: proofs hereof are, 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. from the ancient Exerciſe of propheſie among the Jews; for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were then and there not known to be Apoſtles, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as gifted Jews, and ſo manifeſted of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſitting in the Seat deſigned to that end; which alſo is to be ſuppoſed of Chriſt oft: 2. and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170225:92"/> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.30. in <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to one or any <hi>that ſitteth, i. e.</hi> if it appear by the Sitters in that Exerciſe, that much of the time will be employed by the after-ſpeakers, let the firſt contrive his matter accordingly, that each may have his courſe, and the Ordinance duly diſcharged. 3. from the light of Nature, the former grounds conſidered:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that there may be an aim in the firſt Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker how to contrive his time.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the more honeſting the exerciſe it ſelf, by putting ſome difference between the Speakers, and not Speakers, in that Exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for the better opportunity of ſpeaking and hearing; yea, and of being ſeen: neither is there inſinuation of any office thereby, if there be no aſſignment of the Speakers, nor of their Text or Doctrine by the Church or Elders; and if their original be taken from their memberſhips, gifted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their exerciſe, and viciſſitude be ordered amongſt themſelves, and kept diſtinct from the officers, exerciſed by a diſtinct prayer, time, and place; and alſo by a more ſocial and leſs authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative ſpeaking then the Teaching-Officers, even in the beſt enabled, eſpecially in the Rulers, who elſe by their other authority and ſitting with the Miniſters of the Word, and in likelyhood by their betterneſs of gifts, will much endanger the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs of the body of Chriſt, ſo charged <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. to 8. which is worſe, then their gracing the Exerciſe by their office is good.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A diſtinct meaſure of time, emphaſis, and authority, in the utterance, is to be obſerved, from the Miniſters, according to their leſs authority,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170225:92"/> promiſe, charge, and gift, leſt confuſion and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grow by the Members Uſurpation on the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; there is rather doubt that the Prophets have no proper authority, but a right to publiſh the Law of God, which hath the legal authority of God in it ſelf: whereto is added the Miniſteriall authority of Chriſt in his offices, Prophetical in the Teacher, Prieſtly in the Exhorter, and Kingly in both, as inſtituted by its extraordinary Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and as ordered by its Ordinary, as the Church-Rulers; which alſo to diſobey, addeth greatly to the other diſobediences to the Word perſonally or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically read, expounded, and applyed; yet ſince every one that is truly ſent to publiſh the Word, hath a kind of authority, the degrees are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be inſiſted on in the greater promiſe of a bleſſing to the Miniſterial than to the membral Deputations of Chriſt, and of like confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation thereof: in the greater charge and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to obey; and alſo in the greater meaſure of gifts, which are to be ſuppoſed in the Miniſters, whereof an anſwerable ſucceſs is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. None hath right to exerciſe as a Prophet out of a Church-Aſſembly, at leaſt but to Church members, much leſs one that is no Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whether within or without the Church; though they may, and that ſucceſsfully, to the begetting and nouriſhing Faith and its fruits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame gift, becauſe and as it is perſonal, which alſo hath a leſs meaſure of authority, charge, promiſe, and gifts annexed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The ſcope of the Prophets is to ſpeak to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170225:93"/> edification, exhortation, and comfort of the Church, and not for triall, no nor exerciſe of gifts, though both may alſo yield that uſe; and therefore diſtinct prayer in thoſe reſpects onely is not good, though the goodneſs of prayer alone be added, becauſe it is here uſed as a Sanctifier of an action (and not as a diſtinct action) for the edifying, exhorting, or comforting the Church; much leſs is the Churches cuſtome, eſpecially if begun on a divers reaſon, warrant for it, but leaſt of all fear of Innovation, both which are of, through, and for Babyloniſm, and nouriſh up car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes and traditions, yea tyranny in the Church, to the eating the heart of Religion and purity of Worſhip thereout.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, therefore matters of ſin, or diſorder therein, are no more cenſurable within that time, then the ſins and diſorders committed in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Exerciſe, but are to be referred to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Ruling, at leaſt if great and turbulent; but if onely in the length of time, and number, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders agreed by the Prophets, they are to be remedied firſt by the reaſons &amp; perſwaſion of the Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. or by them referred to the cenſure of the Church, in caſe of obſtinacy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, therefore each is to be referred to the knowledge of his own ability, and to his fitting it with Text, Doctrine, and Manner; for the fruit is much diminiſhed by the inequality of the matter and ability.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, though reſpect be to be had of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in many mean circumſtances and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the main of the courſe is not to be ſhaped, nor altered for them.</p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:170225:93"/>
                     <p>Again briefly of the Organical and five Officers there are five diſtinct objects, functions, portions, and proportions of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. with 3, 4, 5, 6. The firſt is of the Teacher, who is <hi>v.</hi> 7. confined within Teaching, which is fourfold, Lingual, Grammatical, Logical, and Ethical. The firſt is, his apt expreſſing the Original Tongues, by the Mother-Tongue of the Church. The ſecond is his apt expounding the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in the Grammer Phraſes and Figures; either in his own perſon, or metaphraſtically in the perſon of the Writer. The third is, his analytical dividing the word of truth aright into its proper parts, and his genetical incorporating them into one body, enſpired or enſouled by the ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt. The fourth is, his diſtinct extracting the Doctrines of the Holy Ghoſt teſtimentary and preceptive, and the genuine conſequences from them, both confirming and confuting; and his ſuaſive preſſing them to approbation.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is of the Exhorter, which is there called Exhortation, which is either unto good, &amp; from evil, or to ſtay in good, or flee out of evil; which four are peculiarly called Exhortation, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Comfort, and Terrour. Now the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and ſinging Pſalms, being both teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly exhorting, and exhortingly teaching, are the works of both theſe Offices, but moſt plenari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly of the Exhorter; but prayer is equally common not only to theſe two, but to the other three Offices, before and after the execution of their offices; and that in reſpect of their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not onely of their perſons.</p>
                     <p>The third is that of the Ruler, which conſiſteth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170225:94"/> in ordering of others in the execution of their <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and the Church in its Church-duties, as its decreeing, admiſſion, excommunication, ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, degradation, &amp;c. or in executing his own; the former is his ordering the Church unto, and in its Aſſembly, and in its Members and Officers, unto and in their Church-works late mentioned and promiſed: the latter is his admitting, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating members, ordaining, degrading Officers, and diſmiſſing the Church, and in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches and perſons, and abſent members, to receive and read in the Church their Letters, and write and ſend to them; in this reſpect he is written unto, under the name of the Angel of the Church, ſeven times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> and charged with the faults of their Churches, as not uſing their offices to their beſt redreſſing them, and commended for their good, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Function of the Diſtributer, to provide for the relief of the Poor of the Church, by the richer ones thereof, and to do all the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church in matter of proviſion, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Church-ſtock, buying, ſelling, or building, or ordering its meeting-place, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing its neceſſary Suits in the Law, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bread, wine, water, and other neceſſaries, for the Elders, Biſhops, or Paſtors proper diſcharge of their offices; in which reſpect he is called the Servant, Helper, and Deacon of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt and leaſt is the Function of the Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, ſhewer of mercy, Widow, or Deaconneſs of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is to tend upon the health of each member thereof in caſes of need, as in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170225:94"/> child-birth, and in all matters of preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their perſons: ſo that by theſe five offices, and their functions, all the needs of the <hi>Church</hi> are ſupplyed, as by the five offices of Chriſt our Prophet, Prieſt, King, Provider, and Preſerver, and the anſwerable gifts of the mind infuſed, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, and humane innate abilities, three whereof are the three faculties of the reaſonable ſoul, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, applying, and expreſſing; and two of the ſenſitive, <hi>i.e.</hi> deſire-of proviſion, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and ſo all Gods promiſes, Chriſts purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the Spirits graces for us, and all that Faith, Hope, and Love expect in this life, is in theſe as in the immediate niples, ſpoons, and hands of the nurſing Mother, the Church encorporate, for the viſible preſervation of the myſtical or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Church, wherein the one half of the ſpecial uſes and ends promiſed, is performed; and the other half will be ſhewn after my preſent ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary manner, by obſerving in them all, God as our Lord, as in the former half he is ſhewn to be Jeſus, or our Saviour (which two are the ſole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.) for they are means of Gods ſanctifying both for his ſervice, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and that convertibly; for whatſoever is divinely to ſerve God, is divinely to preſerve his; and <hi>è contra;</hi> and wherein can he be more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by us, than by our acknowledging of all theſe to be means of, and by God, for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of all them, and our ſelves alſo to be for Gods ſervice and worſhip? for if they be for Gods Divine Worſhip, and our ſpiritual welfare, what can be of a greater neceſſity of duty, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluder of Rebellion againſt God, or murder of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170225:95"/> our own ſoules? eſpecially ſince they are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be <hi>that good, acceptable, and perfect Will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2. <hi>That Word-worſhip</hi> ſo vehemently preſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 1. unto the approbation of both which, we muſt <hi>be transformed into a renewedneſs of mind,</hi> and diſconformed from the World-worſhip, (as dead, unholy, and unacceptable unto God, <hi>v.</hi> 1.) and renounce our own Wills, as <hi>evil, odious, and imperfect,</hi> v. 2. by which high dignity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander and Commender of theſe for his own peculiar Divine Worſhip, and his Worſhippers eternal glory, and the Divine Nature of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Worſhippers, and the heavenly end of the former, and benefit to the latter; and alſo by the Deity of the Mediator, and inſpirer of them thus manifeſted, another promiſed branch is alſo performed, but competently indeed, in reſpect of what may more be ſaid of them; yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, being compared with the dignity of any other thing but God their original Author, and ultimate End; and his Saints, for whom they and all things but God are, and by and for whom they are exerciſed, and their Inſtitutors and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Declarer; and Grace, and Heaven, for which they are: But I haſte to their further dignifying, by ſhewing the odious baſeneſs of their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, Antichriſt and his Worſhip, having only firſt marſhalled them into their comely order, lineal and collateral.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. Gods natural works are highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled in that <hi>their line is gone through the Earth, and their words unto the ends of the World,</hi> v. 4. and the like is ſaid of the Sun, <hi>v.</hi> 6. but the extenſion of Gods ſpiritual works are far more magnified in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170225:95"/> the reſt of that Pſalm; and throughout that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Record, nothing is more evident and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both in lineal and collateral extenſion, than the pillar and ground of true Worſhip, which is the Houſe and Church of the Living God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. For the Word is Truth, both as the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of the Truth of Salvation, and alſo of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but the Church is not the pillar and ground of the former, but of the latter it is, as ſhall be ſynopſed preſently, which alſo beſt ſorteth with the ſubject of that whole Epiſtle, eſpecially at that part thereof, which is an inſtruction of <hi>Timothy,</hi> how to behave himſelf in ordering and acting Gods publike worſhip.</p>
                     <p>The rock and root of this line is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the abſolute Willer thereof; the Anchor or Hank end thereof is Chriſt as the original Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer thereof; his immediate Deputies therein are the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, by their precepts and practice thereof, the Divine Record whereof is their Writings of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, a Divine Progeny, and previal Line in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: but the internal Line hath five parts: 1. The Church. 2. The power thereof. 3. The Church-eſtates. 4. Their Functions, <gap reason="foreign">

Their object or matter: What theſe five things are, is ſhewn; but I onely touch their lineal or ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive order. The filial or poſterial Line of Gods Worſhip extendeth to all publike union and communion with God and his Saints, in all grace and glory: Firſt, in this life, as an Earneſt, Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal, Livery of ſeiſine, and Court or Temple of <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and the very Heaven; an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170225:96"/> Iſſue, and Inheritance indeed! and ſo a Royal Race, and Heavenly Line indeed!</p>
                     <p>The collateral reſpect of Divine Worſhip is either internal or external: the former is the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of its parts; which is actual in its four laſt parts, and virtual in the Church, as cauſally reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting each branch of the four brotherhoods; each whereof hath nine particulars, according to the number of the Church-eſtates, or Memberſhips; 4. Whereof are integral as Children, Women, Men, and Prophets. And 5. Organical or Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, as the Teacher, the Exhorter, the Diſtributer, the Ruler, the pitier, whoſe 9. portions, priviledges, or proportions of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 6. or Functions, <hi>v.</hi> 4. may by theſe nine terms be underſtood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, ſubmiſſive, active, inſtructive, teaching, exhorting, diſtributing, ruling, and pittying; but the particulars of the matter, wherein thoſe Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to be exerciſed, cannot ſo briefly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but by reference to what is ſaid of them, which is ſufficient for this place; over, unto, in, by and for theſe brotherhoods is the Church power, authoritative over them, in giving them their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or eſſentiative unto them, preſervative in them, uſive by them, beneficial for them; for all gifts, miniſtrations, and operations are given to the Church to profit each other member, its Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and its matter to be executed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                     <p>The external fraternity of our Evangelical Divine Worſhip is either ſpiritual or natural; the ſpiritual is either cotypical or antitypical; the particulars of them all are 7; five are paſt, one is, and the ſeventh is to come; ſo exactly is this white Line parallel'd with that black one, in

                        <hi>that,</hi> which taken demonſtratively, muſt have reference to <hi>that Word-worſhip,</hi> v. 1. which expreſſeth <hi>that will,</hi> v. 2. to be the efficient cauſe of <hi>that Worſhip,</hi> v. 1. and its particulars, <hi>v.</hi> 4. to 8. and the joynt cauſe thereof with the word; yea, of them both, which exceedingly dignifieth our ſubject of <hi>Worſhip;</hi> or taken <hi>per emphaſin</hi> (which the urging thereby to diſconformity with <hi>World-worſhip,</hi> and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in grace; and the emphatical <hi>that,</hi> v. 1. <hi>that Word-worſhip,</hi> neceſſite) it expreſſeth worth and neceſſity of this knowledge of the higheſt nature; yea, that double demonſtrative emphaſis; importeth an unexpreſſable dignity and neceſſity thereof. Which latter ſenſe not onely excludeth the former, but alſo importeth, yea enforceth it, by the mutual emphaſing, and inſeparable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the two emphaſed matters.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, beſide the compacture of the number of particulars in the five laſt verſes in the latter Table ſhewn, there is a ſpecial diſtinctneſs of thoſe particulars to be obſerved, preſſed <hi>v.</hi> 3. and expreſſed in the metaphraſe, analyſis and geneſis thereof: Therefore there is not onely all kind of knowledge requiſite unto this ſpecial matter; but alſo in the ſame, how to diſcern the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, their joynt encorporating and enchai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170225:105"/> and their diſtinct order both lineal and collateral.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, another proof of the ſame kind is from the like compacture of all manner of complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of this ſubject both lineal, <hi>a priori &amp; poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi> and collatera, dextral, and ſiniſtral, ſhewn in the main part of the former Table ſummarily, and ſhall be in this proſecution, thereof illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that therein the Deity, in its Unity and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as α &amp; ω, the efficient and end; &amp; in all its ordering means, and actuating powers, Natural and Civil, Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical, perſonal &amp; publike, pleaſeth to encircle &amp; embrace this his own inſtituted Son, Image, and Spouſe; as thereby parallelling his adopted and imputed myſtical Church, the particular matter of this his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church: of both which conjoyned and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he intendeth the compleating of his perfect celeſtial Church: By theſe glimpſes you may diſcern in this proof, ſtrength enough to evince the matter in hand, that the ſubject of Divine Worſhip is very worthy of our knowledge, and beſt endeavours to underſtand, even as any thing knowable: for Gods eſſence none can know, and live a natural life: and ſo there is no corrival but the myſtical Church, and the like relation of the Deity to it, and of it again to the Deity, which is the ſoul of our preſent body, as in the next proof.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, 1. call to mind here the manifold motives, and divine commands, to get knowledge, underſtanding, and wiſdome; and the ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and plenty of teaching thereof in the word. and 2. the world-cloying Volumes thereof, of the

                     <p>Eightly, Obedience then to God, neceſſiteth us to know theſe his peculiar commands, and the love of God conſtraineth us thereto: the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency alſo of the matter and its order, both inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and relative, lineal and collateral, ſtrongly moveth us thereto: which two heads ſhew it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and perfect in it ſelf; if now it alſo appear ſpecially beneficial to us, then it wanteth nothing to prove it that good, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and perfect will of God; for that therefore, mind the ends thereof, and you ſhall find the one half for our good: for as they are for Gods glory and worſhip, which proveth them to be ſon-like duties of love to our Father upward: ſo are they for our good five ſeveral ways, and ſo they are means, and ſo duties of wiſdome for our own and brethrens benefit; and ſo we thereby ſerve God immediatly, as in Duties of the firſt Table, and mediatly as in the ſecond, therein alſo ſerving and preſerving our ſelves in wiſdome, and our equals in love.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe five is in getting knowledge of all kinds of good to be obtained, and the Science of Science it ſelf; and ſo of the means and manner of obtaining them: which is proved, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Propheſie,</hi> which is expreſſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. to be for edifying, which cannot be without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and its counter-diſtinction from exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort, proveth knowledge to be meant thereby: and <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>the Teacher within teaching:</hi> So one whole office with its function and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170225:107"/> exerciſing, is for our information.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is in getting grace, ſincerity, and holy power and vertues of all ſorts, which both are proper and prime good things, and the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifiers of all other goods, whereby they become onely good to us, yea and of all evils alſo, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to our good, whereby even our ſins are our phyſick, and many wayes for our benefit in their co-operation and laſt end: This is alſo proved, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Propheſie,</hi> with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and comfort:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>The Exhorter within Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;</hi> and ſo alſo the whole 2d. office, and its miniſtration, and adminiſtring, are for our internal ſanctification of Heart and Affections.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Ruling-Miniſtry, and its Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Works, are for the external nouriſhment of both theſe internals, and ſuppreſſion of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Hereſies and wickedneſs in the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>the Ruler.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God hath given to the Church not onely authoritative and magiſterial Labourers in the Word and Doctrine, and Rulers, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. with their miniſterial information, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and government, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. but alſo inferiour and ſervant-like helpers, and their works of ſervant-like <hi>helps, ibid.</hi> both for our perſonal proviſion in and by the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>the Diſtributer, i. e.</hi> the Orderer and Diſpoſer of the proviſion of the Church (by a Synecdoche of one particular for the general, whereof there are many branches, of which more at large elſe-where) and alſo fiftly for our perſonal preſervation in health and life, <hi>ibid.</hi> the <hi>Pittier</hi> or <hi>Shewer of Mercy</hi> to the perſons of the

                        <hi>Church</hi> in need thereof; called alſo <hi>Deacons, Rom.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. as alſo the fourth ſort are: Theſe are alſo called Widows, becauſe they muſt be widows that be admitted to this office, and alſo of 60. years old, leſt they ſhould by nature be urged to marry, and by their husbands be hindered in their office, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.3, 9. to 16. For two Inſtitutions of <hi>God</hi> muſt not oppoſe, nor croſs each other, as being in act; nor the courſe of Nature and its Inſtitutions be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted nor everted: ſo that all ſorts of good are treaſured up for us by <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Church-worſhip:</hi> therefore ſpare no labour to know, nor coſt to buy the ſame, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11, 44, 45.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, <hi>v.</hi> 5. it is expreſſed that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar matter of this Divine Worſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſtians are encorporated and enchained together therein for each others benefit, and made as members of each other: ſo that both the particulars of the miniſterial and myſtical <hi>Church,</hi> are for the good of each Chriſtian, as eſtated in Gods inſtituted Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, while the 5. particulars of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for our fivefold or omnifold good, are freſhly mentioned, I will add a tenth proof and motive to this point, conjoining the perfect good, and the good perfection of Divine Worſhip in one ſmall Table, wherein alſo many other motives thereto, and matters worthy our obſervation will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.</p>

Alas! that this kind of Knowledge is ſo unknown, and the pearl and treaſure thereof as hid in the earth; though like, yea being Wiſdoms houſe, pillars and food propoſed to, yea proclaimed for us, with many and manifold motives by her maidens, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1 to 12. and though ſo unlike the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary falſe worſhip and folly of Antichriſt, that fooliſh Whore, and whoriſh folly ſo vilified and deterred in the reſt of that Chapter, as illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting true worſhip by its contrary; the particulars of this worſhip are ſo many and magnifyed, that I dare not move by one of them.</p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:170225:111"/>
                     <p>Eleventhly, This word-worſhip is the ſubject of the greateſt part of the Scripture, in its deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the particulars thereof, preſcribing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof, prohibiting the contrary, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the practiſes of both ſorts, and the anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bleſſings and judgments, and making uſe thereof for future encouragements, and terrours of the proceeders; and adding farther comforts and threatnings accordingly: but the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing hereof, requiring a kind of Expoſition of half the Scripture, I muſt refer the marking this point in your daily readings thereof; wherein you ſhall find theſe things exceeding uſeful, and worthy your knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, the great and many bleſſings of the Word are annexed to this true divine worſhip, and the plenty of fierce Curſes are denounced againſt the falſe; and becauſe this and the other are too large to proſecute to the full, ſee both verified in the Decalogue-Epitome thereof in the ſecond Commandement; for that is ſo large as all the reſt, except the fourth Commandement (which inſtituteth Gods ſet time, for the celebration thereof, and ſo it rather ſecondeth than affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our point) and pronounceth moe and higher bleſſings, and denounceth heavier judgments in this matter, than all the body of the Decalogue beſide.</p>
                     <p>But I more need to excuſe my prolixneſs herein, and to break off from the many proofs of, and motives to this point, then to proceed herein; both ſince the matter is ſo pregnant, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining points ſo many and ſpecial, above my
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170225:111"/> ability to accompliſh, &amp; your patience to read, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be more then vulgarly <hi>transformed</hi> for this purpoſe, which <hi>v.</hi> 2. requireth; and alſo the ſuppreſſedneſs of the matter, by the wrong expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this place and its parallels, and the wronging oppoſition of their ſubject, than which none is greater.</p>
                     <p>And therefore having made ſome uſe of the point and proofs, I will paſs to other; for if I ſhould inſtance the particulars of this Worſhip, I ſhould be drowned in the multitude of their ſpecial motives to this point of the worth and need of their knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Since then Evangelical Worſhip is ſo many and main wayes worthy and neceſſary to be known, why is the knowledge thereof ſo ſlighted as worthleſs and uſeleſs? and that not onely by the world, and its world-worſhippers (for I as much ſlight the ſlightings, and the fightings of Chriſts adverſaries) but by the Lovers of the Word, and alſo of Gods worſhip in the general, and of the particulars thereof which they hold ſo to be, <hi>i. e.</hi> of preaching the Word, adminiſtring the Sacraments and Prayer: But the main and radical parts thereof, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church as encor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated and congregated, the diverſities of its Miniſtries and their Functions, their derivation from the Church, their miniſtration, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſervice in and unto that Church, their ſet, number and nature, and their diſtinct collateral order; and more the more particular appropriating of Divine Ruling order and acts to the proper Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of ſuch a Church, and in its Congregation: but moſt of all, the moſt particular act of that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170225:112"/> Ruler in admiſſion and ordination; and the knowledge whether thoſe acts, or the decree of the Congregation give the being to a member or Miniſter of a Church.</p>
                     <p>All theſe, and divers other points of great uſe and worth, they hold to be Walls, Hedges, Orders, and Circumſtances of Religion and Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but not of the ſubſtance thereof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put off the knowledge thereof, in pretence of their love and eſteem of the ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Alas! that Profeſſours of Religion ſhould thus he Uſhers of Antichriſts Hall, to make room for his entrance, Porters of his tryumphant chair of eſtate, to bring him in, and ſupporters of his Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy with their own ſhoulders, upon ſuch groundleſs pretences; for Antichriſtianiſme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the confuſion of thoſe main points of Religion, and thereby thoſe things which they call the ſubſtance of Religion.</p>
                     <p>But firſt <hi>ad hominem,</hi> hath God ſet them for walls of defence of his true worſhip and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? and will they (through ignorant negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence) relinquiſh the walls to their and their Kings mortal enemy? ſince the winning the Walls is the winning the City, and all therein, and the ſubjecting themſelves to the enemy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his ſervice (direct or indirect) or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yea, in God's Matters to both, if to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hath God bounded his Services with Hedges, Dikes, or other Fences and Circumferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to diſtinguiſh Chriſts ſervants and ſervices from Antichriſts? and ſhall we ſlight Antichriſts

                     <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe we the word, Sacraments and Prayer to be the materials of Chriſts and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Communion; ſhall we therefore like Swine, eat of his meat, without obſervance of the order he hath ſet for their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Miniſters, according to their diſtinct offices and functions, and that as parts of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or court of his own forming.</p>
                     <p>The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſhameth theſe Borderers on <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for ſhe came from the utmoſt parts of the Earth <hi>to know the wiſdome of</hi> Solomon, <hi>and obſerved the houſe which he had built,</hi> and the meat of his Table, and the ſitting of his Servants, and the attendance of his Miniſters, and their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and his Butlers and their apparel, and his aſcent to the houſe of God; and ſhe admired them, and pronounced him and them bleſſed of God therein; and God bleſſed thereby, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.1. to 8. But theſe eaters of the meat of the greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> come from Heaven to them; obſerve, not much leſs admire Chriſts wiſdome, Love and Will in his houſe formed by himſelf, in the offices and ſet-eſtates thereof, and their orderly attendance and adminiſtration of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170225:113"/> them, and the comely ornaments of them all, and the diſtinctneſs of the particular officers and their functions and beauty; and alſo their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reciprocal to God and his houſe, and the mutual bleſſings communicated in all theſe: Nay, they rather as ſenſual gluttons, and ſelf-feeders, luſt after and ſuck up his wine and milk, without ſeeking after his wiſdome, and perfect order therein, loving him for his goodneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or obeying him in his holy and ſo acceptable Will and Command in them all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they learned not of <hi>David</hi> to ſpeak ſo ſlightly of theſe diſtinct Orders and Offices of the Church, and their neceſſited relation to the Ark, and the like adminiſtrations of the Prieſts and Levites, as to call them circumſtances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for he ſaith, that becauſe they were not there in their Orders at the bringing home of the Ark, God made that great breach in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſought him, yet they negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Miniſterial Order God had preſcribed for his Worſhip, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2, to 13. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.4, 15. Nor of <hi>Moſes</hi> to neglect an hoof, in way of compleat readineſs for Gods ſervice; much leſs would he neglect the leaſt hoof, after it was ſanctified by God for that end.</p>
                     <p>But what do they mean by circumſtances di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly?</p>
                     <p>They are vulgarly known to be three, <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Perſons;</hi> onely the third then can be the controverſie: Whether it be material in the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer publike, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtreth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170225:113"/> them, whether an inſtituted Officer or no: But they are ſo far from holding the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> adminiſtrable by any out of an inſtituted of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that they impoſe a neceſſity therof in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying in the congregation; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Proteſtants out of the congregration alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by reading, eſpecially in preaching; ſince then they hold the miniſtry of the Church and i'ts adminiſtration ſo neceſſary unto &amp; in preaching, Sacraments and prayer in Gods worſhip: why villifie they our neceſſiting this Church eſtate to be diſtinctly known, purpoſed and practiſed, as a pertinent point of Gods worſhip? But now to paſs from theſe motives <hi>ab homine</hi> unto the greater <hi>à Deo,</hi> call to mind the conſtant neceſſity of this official Celebration of all inſtituted ordinances, ſince God ſet up a ſet Church-miniſtry teaching, exhorting, ruleing, and ſerving; and helping me and your ſelf herein, read <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. to 8:8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. to 31.33. to <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. to 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. to 46.

                     <p>Thirdly, the particular Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> are expreſly ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. to be the houſes of God, and that without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity, and therefore indefinitly, and as ſuch; and therefore of every particular Church: for <hi>quod, eſt quatenus ipſum eſt de omni:</hi> That Church alſo indefinitly taken, and ſo every particular Church is there ſaid to be the pinacle and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the firſt evidencer and evident part of divine true worſhip, and the radical ground, ſubjective chair, and proper baſis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and the then true Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſaid to be the body of that <hi>word-worſhip</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5. as above is particularized; for by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>v.</hi> 5. with <hi>v.</hi> 1. it is cleered to be a particular part of that <hi>word-worſhip;</hi> and with <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. to be the body and ſubject thereof, which is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170225:115"/> ſo evident in that place, that I will not farther prove it; but even by It prove, what is inferred from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. againſt the two oppoſitions thereof: The former is by expounding the word <hi>Truth</hi> onely of the Doctrines of Faith and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but are not the Doctrines of Gods Word of truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. concerning his true worſhip inſtituted onely thereby, and our anſwerable holy ſerving him therein, ſo well as thoſe concerning Faith and Holineſs perſonal? Why are they not ſo proper, yea ſo ſpecial truths of that word of truth?</p>
                     <p>Nay, they are more proper to the Church, ſince Faith and its perſonal fruits are proper and immediate to the perſon of each Chriſtian, and the other parts of worſhip proper and immediate to the Church; yea theſe have no other ſubject, pinacle, pillar, chair, nor ground; neither can they ſubſiſt nor exiſt in act, but as, of, and in the Church; but Faith, and therefore all its fruits are in their perfection of parts in each true <hi>adult</hi> ſon, called and regenerate, before he is admitted into a Church; for he is thereinto received, as being ſuch, and not as to be made ſuch; and again upon manifeſtation that he is not ſuch, he is rejected and caſt thereout, as not fit to be of the Church; and therefore is he not to expect nor receive his Faith in, from, or by the Church; how then is it the Fountain or Root of the Scripture-Goſpel, or Doctrine of Salvation by Faith working by love, as ſo working, as the Papiſts hold as their life on the one ſide? Or as the Controverters againſt the ſame ſay, How is it the Poſt or Paſquil pillar of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereon all publike notifications uſe to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170225:116"/> be affixed, in reſpect of its ſhewing Faith unto the paſſers by? A very poor interpretation of that place, and an embaſing of the Church; which to dignifie in a ſpecial manner, is the ſcope of that ſentence; wherein the Popiſh Expoſition is the far better; onely, whereas this high dignifying the Church (to provoke <hi>Timothy,</hi> and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers thereof, to a reverent, diligent, and cheerful diſcharge of their Miniſtry therein) is by the word as its Dignifier, and ſo it is evident that the dignity of the cauſall priority, and the fundamental and fontal original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the word it ſelf, as the proper truth of <hi>God, Joh.</hi> 17.17. is excepted, as God is excepted in this expreſs univerſal aſſertion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. <hi>For he hath put all things under his</hi> (Chriſts) <hi>feet,</hi> wch is in the next words expreſſed: <hi>But when he ſaith all things are put under his feet, it is evident that he is excepted, which did put all things under him:</hi> ſo that that, is as evidently falſe as the other, though not ſo unſavoury and ridiculous, in making the Church it ſelf but a Bill-poſt of truth, which hath but this goodnes to oppoſe the falſhood of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; nor excuſe, but that they know not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaning of <hi>truth</hi> in that place, nor the diſtinct acception thereof for true worſhip in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, both in its poſitive and privative uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yea and both for divine worſhip in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and alſo more particularly for theſe ſpecial particulars thereof in hand: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. <hi>Who turned the truth of God into a lye</hi> (or the true worſhip of God into falſe) <hi>and worſhipped and ſerved the Creature rather then the Creator, i. e.</hi> in their worſhipping and ſerving him in, by, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170225:116"/> created reſemblances, which God accounteth for a ſerving the creature (according to all Gods natural courſes and appearances, and no inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſuppoſing any other) rather than their Creatour, whoſe Will they were to know in that their divine Worſhip; for of the Idolatries in the Scripture, both of the Jews and Gentiles, there is no one wherein by the intent of the Worſhipper, there was any other original perſon of the Deity adored than the ſame which we adore as Creator of the world.

                     <p>The other reaſon is, becauſe the ſame ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in kind are ſanctified and bleſſed by GOD, eſpecially by Chriſt under the Goſpel, or at, or ſince his coming in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>This is the Soul, Spirit, and Life of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme, typical before Chriſt, and antitypical
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170225:117"/> ſince: as the other reaſon is of Heatheniſme; which conſiſting of inſtinctive devotion of Will, and this of diſtinctive notion of Wit, ſo neceſſite a concord between the blind and the lame, that the God of this World, and its World-worſhip, hath ever compounded, or rather confounded his World-worſhip of theſe two; though the former more predominateth in Heatheniſme; and the latter in Antichriſtianiſme: yet do both by the former palliate the ignorant multitude; and by the latter, the wiſe, learned, witty, and practick ſort: and by an aſſociative mixture of both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch and beſot the whole world, except the few whoſe names are written in the Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13:3, 8.15:2. 18:4. 20:4. or through their guilded hypocriſie ſeem ſo to them that are, as <hi>Judas</hi> did to the other Apoſtles, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> (his type) to <hi>David, Simon Magus</hi> to <hi>Peter, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. who yet like a Mer-man, Sea-lew, Sea-horſe, Dog-fiſh, &amp;c. will make a ſhift to live in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and by twy-light to ſeem a courſe man, Lyon, Horſe, Dog, &amp;c. to the ſand-blind, or ſemi-blind, while their tails or hind-parts are in the water, who yet long for the Sea-banks of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and by day may and will be diſcovered to be but Dagons of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> and Fiſhes of the Antichriſtian Sea, either Meer main, and <hi>Romane,</hi> or mixt mean or <hi>Britromane,</hi> and that they were but maſſingilt, not maſſie-gold, which Chriſts Temple and Templaries ought, to be toward, and through him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.21, 22.</p>
                     <p>The particulars of this falſe-inſtituted Divine, (or rather undivine or diviline) worſhipping

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170225:150"/> under the 2. degree of that ſinne and judgment: but if it proceed to the leaſt ſort of particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of matter of a brothers diſcredit, though it be but of his wiſdome, it is expreſſed to be of the higheſt ſort of ſins and judgment, at leaſt of that Commandement: yet <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11, 12. expreſſeth it to be a reproaching and cenſuring of the Word of God it ſelf, and an uſurpation of Gods Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Supremacy, and an oppoſition againſt God that is alone able to ſave and to deſtroy, and thereupon thundereth againſt this reproacher with <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another brother?</hi> which laſt word is expreſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and ſheweth the true nature and high degree of this ſinne of reproaching; without it the other two parallel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.21. and 18.15. were not its true parallels; and without this peculiar inſtitutedneſs or inſtituted peculiarity of this privacy in preſent conſideration, the other two would ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harſh.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170225:153"/> him for, and given him ability to perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Elſe had man been made an imperfect Creature, which God (being a perfect Entity, and infinite and abſolute in perfection) could not do: and indeed it had been againſt his Juſtice, Wiſdome, and Love, to create the whole Species of mankind to condemnation in and by the principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Moral unadequateneſs of his inſtinctive and impoſed Law, and innate vertue: For the Inſtinctive it needed but ſerious conſideration, it being ſo immediate to Gods original creative act, in his Rationals and Legals, in whom he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly created the Moral Law; and the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Laws were impoſable by a Natural Right, though more remote: yet they being proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts to Gods inſtinctive, are parts of the moral Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the ſecond Commandement, even in the particulars. Therefore God impoſed the whole Paradiſal worſhip on man by his creative right; [which ſee in the enſuing Table of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions] This done, all Gods natural creation was compleat in the addition of Gods natural cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to his inſtinctive Law; but immediatly therewith did God alſo add thereto an heavenly typicalneſs, as a divine Sign of Heaven, and all its particulars, attainable by mans fulfilling them as ſuch, by his innate vertue; which as the caſe then ſtood was impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>The Natural Law was created with man, which appears by <hi>Cains</hi> knowledge of his murther to be a ſinne (as is manifeſt by his denyal of his brother) before the Law publiſhed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. chiefly <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:170225:153"/>
                     <p>Yet was not this a prohibition with a penalty nor an impoſed Law or inſtitution, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to man to accept or refuſe, and if accepted then to be as a thing conditional for life upon performance; or death in caſe of fayling; (as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. appeares) <hi>For in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> And in the 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> and the 3. <hi>ver. Ye ſhall not eat of the fruit of the Tree in the middeſt of the Garden, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye dye:</hi> As if God had ſaid, I do not impoſe this as a command, but onely propoſe it with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That if thou do'ſt undertake to keep it as a Law, and not perform it, thou ſhalt dye: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it, thou ſhalt live. Otherwiſe, had God been the Author of his Fall, in giving him a Law beyond his inſtinctive power of obedience: Yet it being accepted ſo, it became a Law of works unto man, for his more then created life in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or death in hell: And more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
                     <p>The Tree of Life was planted by the Tree of Knowledge; implying, life was the reward to the performance of this Law; and death the penalty, as before expreſly denounced for the breach. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.19, 20, to 28. is a reſemblance of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>Thus theſe were Signs and Seals Sacramental, as Livery and Seiſin of a Spiritual Eſtate; the one of Heaven, the other of Hell.</p>

                        <p>The firſt hereof <hi>viz.</hi> the tree of life (firſt in time, nature and dignity) entred man into a heavenly ſtate; But becauſe it was conditional, and gave not an anſwerable heavenly nature, which the Goſpel Sacraments do; <hi>Adam</hi> was miſtaken in his conceited power of obedience.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>Adam</hi> not being as yet acquainted with Faith and the Goſpel righteouſneſs, (that being not mentioned till the end of that day which was after the fall) but onely looking upon his own facile native obedience of the Moral Law, (and not obſerving the dative and inſtinctive power cocreated to the performance thereof) and of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170225:154"/> that onely, thought he could as well by his own ability do all that could be propoſed although in ſtative righteouſneſs, as he had done all that was impoſed: And therefore not doubting his power of obedience, nor fearing the penalty, nor any prejudice that could be due to the failing part or non-performance thereof, and looking upon the promiſed prize of a hevenly life, as clear gains, did accept of this propoſition, and out of his own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (without deſire of aſſiſtance of heavenly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, though in a heavenly work) did undertake the keeping and obſervance of this Law; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there was no reaſon in nature to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The firſt Covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. in the Tree of Life is enlarged in <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5.</p>
                        <p>But the Angels of mentity, of light, (thence <hi>JOB</hi> calls them <hi>Luciferians</hi>) and order, conceiving man coming into the ſon-like ſtate, and thereby in a condition of greater excellence, and of priority, and of precedency of them, did envy him, and that their conceited happineſs of his: which ambition, pride, and envy, ſpurr'd them to an immediate practice, for the ruine and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of man: for they being ſervants, and not ſons of heaven, and therefore in their created nature they not knowing the far higher eſtate of Chriſt, (and his body of Saints) Gods deſtinate heir of heaven, conceived <hi>Adam</hi> able to have performed the condition, and therefore alſo conceived that he had been poſitively eſtabliſhed by God to have been the heir of heaven, and ſo their immediate Lord and Maſter, which in their nature was intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and ſcornful; and in God conceived it to be injuſtice, want of love, and contempt of them,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170225:155"/> and therefore would neither ſerve him, nor his new adopted Son, and left their ſervice and their firſt eſtate, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. and wrought all miſchief they could againſt him: But having no power againſt his perſon, they practiſed againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> and being faln from their created eſtate, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally felt and diſcern'd both good and evil, which al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>o <hi>Adam</hi> did after his Fall: though before, neither of them did, but good onely. Now by this conſequence of the Law, they perceived the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Law, and that man was thereby ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as well as they, and therefore ſet all their wits and powers on work, to contrive their breach of it, and ruine by it.</p>
                        <p>And accordingly, poor man, his legal, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel weakneſs was ſuch, that (his former ſupporter, his created power, onely enabling him to the obſervance of the Moral-Law, and not reaching this, which was of a more heavenly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) he was no ſooner attempted then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                        <p>God then curſt the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14, 15. and put enmity betwixt man and him; but before he denounced the Sentence of the curſe due to man for this breach of the firſt Covenant; for the ſupport of weak, frail, and dejected man, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration thereof, God firſt ſhewed him a glimpſe of the Goſpel, in that he gave him a promiſe of mercy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. (and enlarged <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.6, 7.) and full aſſurance of a ſecond victory in Chriſt (which by <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> is called the ſecond Covenant) and thus comforted (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) then let him know his puniſhment, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. to 19, 22, 23, 24.</p>

                        <p>GOd is a pure and perfect entity, that cannot will, nor work any thing but like himſelf, for natural perfection: as the Beaſts were in ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity perfect, till mans ſinne brought alſo on them a curſe, and depravation of that perfection: [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe intentionally made for him, and by donation given into his hands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 28.]</p>
                        <p>The Text expreſly ſaith, <hi>Man was made after his Image.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now God could not work, will, or incline to ill: Therefore nor man to any thing that God had impos'd, and poſitively forbidden him: for if man was made after the perfect Image of God in things natural, then he could not in natural things more offend then God; But God could not, therefore nor Man.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> could in natural things offend more then God, then in natural things <hi>Adam</hi> was not made after the perfect Image of God.</p>
                        <p>Again, God's intention was to contrive man to heaven, (elſe his Decree for Election or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not eternal) and to that end propoſed to him a new Law, with the condition of Heaven, in caſe of obſervance, and Death and Damnation upon the breach: which was propoſed to him, to undertake it, or not to undertake it: But in hopes of the prize of Heaven, and preſuming of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power, not knowing it was a heavenly work, did undertake it; and the condition thereof was to do, or ſuffer: and then, and not before then,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170225:156"/> came the free will of man to do good or ill: That; the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> maintain as their received opinion, (and at the Creation as pretended) but then (as before is proved) had man no power to ill.</p>
                        <p>Now this ſecond Law was propos'd, and not impos'd, for it had been injuſtice in God to have impos'd ſuch a Law upon man, as was impoſſible for man to keep, (which this was, being ſpititual, and man meerly natural) except he had likewiſe given him ability to have kept it, which he did not.</p>
                        <p>That it was ſpiritual, appears by the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Trees of Life; of Knowledge; that were not real life and knowledge, but onely ſignes thereof, &amp; therefore Sacraments. And therefore by this it appears, that this Law was meerly propoſed by God, accepted by Man, and ſo became federal, and a binding Contract betwixt God and Man; and therefore is called the firſt Covenant.</p>
                        <p>To work any man to underſtand this, at the firſt preſs not upon him the propoſition, and liberty to undertake, or not to undertake the keeping of this Law; but firſt let him underſtand the condition, to do or to ſuffer.

                        <p>The general opinion is, that man had power to keep this Law, and power to break it.</p>

                     <p>Bright print of that Covenant viſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and deſcribed by the Sacraments of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, Adam</hi> as the official dreſſer &amp; orderer thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                     <p>And the trees and fruit thereof, eſpecially thoſe of Life and Knowledge, ſignifying Heaven, or <hi>Gods</hi> Palace, City, and Kingdome, and <hi>God</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and raigning with <hi>Adam</hi> therein, and life and all eternal, and perfect, heavenly, and divine hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs therein unto man, if he obſerved and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that Covenant; or the contrary, if he broke it; and that not naturally, but mentally, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, inſtitutively, and ſtatively, ſacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, inſtrumentally, ſealingly, poſſeſſingly, enright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, deliveringly, and ſeiſingly, ſo ſignifying by <hi>Gods</hi> expreſſion therein; which ſo cleerly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and eſtating Covenant, if he entred into, he knew that it bound both parties to exact keeping thereof; whereby, and not before, nor otherwiſe it became a Law conſequently, not originally and ſimply; for though <hi>God</hi> had inſtituted all that to be his worſhip, ſo far as the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extendeth only: yet neither it, nor <hi>Adam</hi> had any heavenly or divine eſtate upon them thereby. And though <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſuppoſed it a glorious and free gift of heaven (as it had been, if he had been of a divine and heavenly nature) yet in <hi>Gods</hi> purpoſe, project, intent, &amp; end, it was an inevitable expoſer of all to <hi>Gods</hi> juſtice, and juſt condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21, 22. and to his glory
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170225:160"/> therein. And ſecondarily, <hi>God</hi> ordered this to be the firſt matter of <hi>Gods</hi> greateſt work of grace and mercy in mans redemption from hell, and adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25. for <hi>Adam</hi> did, and could not but eat of the forbidden fruit, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a breaker of <hi>Gods</hi> Covenant and Law, and loſt his wager, even earthly perfection and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he wagered againſt heavenly, &amp; obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it not, but became guilty of its contrary, even of hell, and perfect and eternal curſe, malice, and miſery. The preceding, worſe, and corruining fall of the Angels upon the ſame rock, and the proofs of both, with their illuſtrations and controverſies are not of this indical ſynopſis, but of its ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vindical illuſtration. But to paſs on toward the third quarter of this quaternity: 1. Man by this his entry into this inſtituted, mental, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Covenant, became ſtative from perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and from earthly to heavenly, and from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal to practional or federal. 2 And as it was meritorious, and upon condition of perfect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly works and obedience, it fitteth the uſual Scripture terms of the Law, Law of Works, Works of the Law, legal, &amp;c. as oppoſite to the Goſpel, Faith, Evangelical, faithful. And thirdly, as it was broken on mans part, it is called enmity, our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty againſt us, the curſe, condemnation, &amp;c. by a Metonymie of the effect for the cauſe, it being the cauſe of all mans ſinfulneſs and miſery here and hereafter. In a fourth reſpect, as it is a means, order, eſtate, project, courſe, ſchoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt and to heaven by him; and man being in that ſtate, it and man may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſignificantly; medial, ordal, artal, ſtative, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170225:161"/> entactive, relative, capital, or mental; which four reſpects of the ſame thing yield this quaternity, federal, legal, enmial, medial, and ſo of other terms of the like uſe. Now as this ſecond part of this microcoſmal quaternity hath a Janal aſpect upon the create &amp; recreate caſe of man, it leadeth us to the recreate caſe; the create being to our purpoſe competently handled.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is <hi>Gods Goſpel-power</hi> unto ſalvation, <hi>i. e.

For by bodies are there meant perſons, by a Metonymie of the continent for the content; for the natural ſoul muſt there be alſo meant; elſe it is not there declared what ſhall then become thereof; and by ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170225:162"/> are meant the glorified natural bodies of the Saints or ſpiritual ones; elſe it is not ſhewn that they ſhall have any; but footing is left for the <hi>Hymenean</hi> and <hi>Philetian</hi> Familiſts, who hold that of the degree, that I ſaid of the kind, confounding that oft-expreſſed diſtinction in the word and world; and ſo deſtroy Faith and Hope on earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. The four reals or naturals of that ſpiritual body or perſon vulgarly confounded, need here to be diſtincted; <hi>i. e.</hi> the 4. ingredients of <hi>Adam's</hi> created body: his body was clay, red-earth, or wet-duſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> of 1. earth; and 2. water; his ſoul was breath; <hi>i. e.</hi> 1. air, and 2. fire; for it is air drawn into the lungs, heated by, and ſo mixed with the ſpirit, fire, or heat of the heart, and breathed out of the body: Thus is mans enſouling by God expreſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. and that he thereby became a living ſoul; So that natural air was the immediate veſſel of the more then natural ſpirit of man, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant with the divine ſpirit of God, and ſo different from fire mixt with air the common matter of the ſenſitive ſouls, and from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe mixed with air; and that it differeth from the eſſence of the deity, needeth no proof: yet is it a living Image of God, imbreathed by himſelf into mans ſoul, whereby he is a living ſoul, and ſo different from all other creatures of a more than te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170225:162"/> him, both which co-operate divine vertues and glory; for as heaven is of a reality different from earth, ſo is the heavenly man from the earthy, and ſo therefore his works and wealth: but this ſpiritualneſs (for thoſe terms are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuous) came by divine promiſe and covenant of heaven (of a ſpiritual and ſupernatural na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) ſigned, ſacramented, ſealed, conveyed by types of Gods own inſtituting and ſanctifying to that end; and therefore they did effect that end of making men that were transformed by Faith in them, to be ſpiritual in our ſenſe of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. to ſay hereon that the air was the immediate veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and baſis of Gods imbreathed Image, ſpiritual nature, and immortal being in man, were a parer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon &amp; paradox; more to ſay that the heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualnes, or ſpiritual heavenlines of the new man, is more properly imputative, inſtitutive, or relative than real; (though its proper gifts, moral and moral, and bleſſings perſonal &amp; poſſeſſal be real) and therefore I refer the cleering to a larger and fitter place, becauſe I conceive them more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and uſeful; than may here be fully ſhewn; where I will add a third, that mercy and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ought to have been expected, endeavoured, and prayed for by <hi>Adam</hi> before Chriſt was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And a fourth, that the means thereof muſt be by the union of perſons offended and offending: A fifth is, that unitable perſon of the Trinity, muſt be the relative, ordive, authoritive, inſtitutive, &amp;c. perſon. A ſixth, that glorious and free mercy, compaſſion, and pitty, muſt be the communicative faculties of this new procreation and birth; but I ceaſe theſe for the preſent: But to return to

By my terming the Goſpel in this reſpect another Law of Works, and by divers other paſſages herein, I clearly ſhew the true nature of the Law of Works, as our ſecond eſtate in hand, and as oppoſite to the goſpel; and alſo of the goſpel; and ſo the true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Gods abſolute, free, powerful, and ſaving efficacy, promiſed and performed in the goſpel, but not in the law; yet have they both the ſame heavenly eſtate; though the Law have it onely in and by Divine Sacramental inſtituted Covenant, and the goſpel have it by Chriſts ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it on him, and compleating it, and imputing that compleating to us, and infuſing its Divine, Spiritual, and incorruptible nature into us in all its kinds, and imparting its happineſs in its true nature, and true hope of all their perfection in degree; which is the difference of the fourth and compleat heavenly eſtate from the two other: of all which three relative eſtates of mankind, the firſt and natural ſtate is the real ſubject and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal hypoſtaſis, without their abrogating the law of nature (ſummed in the Decalogue) in any
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170225:166"/> part, but onely ſanctifying it.</p>
                     <p>HEaven is Gods compleat Divine Kingdome, compleating our three other head eſtates into an higher, diviner, and more heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual degree than is proper to their own nature. It is, 1. ſubjective, native, moral, inſtinctive, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. 2. Projective, ſtative, medial, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative, inſtitutive, diſtinctive, &amp;c. as in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head. 3. Ejective, dative, medal, recreative, modal, pertinctive, conſtitutive, reſtitutive, &amp;c. as in our third head, and frequently in the goſpel. 4. Objective, rative, metal, perbeative, attinctive, contentive, &amp;c. as in this fourth head.</p>
                     <p>In a word, it is the ſub-object, <hi>i. e.</hi> the main, prime, proper, ſole adequate object of the Trinity; the firſt-laſt ſubject of all divined or godded, the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the firſt-laſt godded, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the god-head. For it was the firſt father, or Creatour of time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created Heaven,</hi> in the beginning of time, which is <hi>menſura rerum;</hi> heaven then being the firſt <hi>res</hi> which <hi>God</hi> any way created; and a meaſure being an inſtrument, whoſe eſſence as ſuch, is in its uſe; it gave the being to time, and <hi>God</hi> to heaven; before which there was properly no time, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eternity. For though man, the Law, Chriſt, the goſpel, their ſpiritual gifts, graces and glories, be in time, and ſince the Creation of all other things become heavenly, and ſo all things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo compleat heaven was not the firſt Creature: yet that gain-ſayeth not my aſſertion, that the third heaven was the firſt object or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for <hi>gradus non variant ſed ornant ſpecient,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170225:166"/> adorn, but alter not the kind of things. But how was it the firſt ſubject, ſince till after the whole other Creation, it had no adjuncts created? the want of which deſtroys its ſubjectſhip, the eſſence of a relative as ſuch, being in its correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as he is no husband that hath no wife? &amp;c. The Angels alone make ſufficient anſwer; but <hi>our Father which art in heaven,</hi> and <hi>heaven is my throne,</hi> &amp;c. make a fuller; and maſter and ſervant make a true and competent family, though the maſters wife and children make it compleat; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are Gods houſhold ſervants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. and God begetteth, adopteth, and marryeth Chriſtians; the diſtinctneſs between God and Chriſt, here needeth not. How the Law was an adjunct of heaven, is more doubtful; yet is it ſhewn that its ſtate was heavenly, and that its ſacramentalneſs of heaven eſtated them in that heavenly eſtate, for and to whom it was ſo inſtituted, by the author and order of heaven, and its holy ſigns; now then all things heavenly, are adjuncts to heaven as to their ſubject: but farther, it is that ſtate whereby we are enrighted to heaven, it being fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by Chriſts death and reſurrection, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and publiſhed to us, and received by us, and ſo the law giveth us our heavenly eſtate; and the goſpel, the anſwerable nature; of the compleat degree of both, glorified heaven is but the Apex, Meta, Butt, the higheſt and utmoſt degree, yea and the firſt and loweſt ſtation and foundation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both the law and goſpel are evident, yea emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent adjuncts to heaven; they therefore being now made ours, who were before onely natural men, yea the firſt and legal Covenant was made
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170225:167"/> with and by us onely as natural men; our perſons are now alſo of the nature of that eſtate and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore heavenly; and therefore alſo our perſons are now adjuncts of heaven, and of an heavenly eſtate thereby, and of an heavenly nature by the goſpel; all which three are encor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate and compleated in heaven: wherefore theſe four thus encorporate, make up the firſt-laſt encorporate and compleat godded of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; yea our natural, legal, evangelical, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial eſtates and caſes, being thus encorporate and compleat, make up the glorious and adequate crown, heart, heir, and glory of heaven, in the firſt-laſt, deep-high, largeſt and compleateſt ſtate and ſenſe, we being conſidered as relatively united unto Chriſt the relative perſon of the Trinity, and therefore with the whole Trinity it ſelf; than which more cannot be ſaid of true and perfect happineſs in kind, my proper and immediate aim; but it's hyperbole tranſcendency of glory, joy, and precious benefit, is not to be known nor uttered in this life.</p>
                     <p>God in the firſt words of his Word ſaith, <hi>In the beginning God created heaven:</hi> which Chriſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſaid, <hi>In my Fathers houſe there are many man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> Pallaces for his ſons, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the third Heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and <hi>Paradiſe, v.</hi> 4. which is expreſſed to mean <hi>Gods</hi> eternal kingdome, of heavenly life and glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. and 22.14. eſpecially <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. which is evidently and eminently mentioned in the Scripture, as the higheſt apex, and crown of our happineſs on <hi>Gods</hi> part, or deſire and hope on ours. This heaven is that houſe and throne of <hi>God</hi> which denominateth
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170225:167"/> him to be heavenly; and in that reſpect is he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be prayed unto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2.</p>
                     <p>But our preſent ſubject is that heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. which was in all things compleat at the firſt, but in the divine and immediate correlatives to God, as the Father, King, Husband, and Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are now in framing of natural perſons, eſtated in an heavenly and ſpiritual eſtate by the law, and ennatured of an heavenly and divine nature by the goſpel, and to be enheritanced, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned, bedded and boarded eternally therein, as in the godded goddome of the abſolute eternal God thereof. This heaven is Gods creative houſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. throne and reſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.49. <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 66.1. which he created for that end, as conſiderable by Angels and Man. As it is a ſubject we have handled it already, and in its cauſative reſpects; we are therefore here to reſpect it onely in its original and diſtinct exiſtency and integrality; and then of its divine ſubjectiveneſs, as God ordered it to be the ſole univerſal ſubject of all things, which are not really, properly, and ſimply God: and ſo as it is the one and onely ſubject of the Deity or Trinity: In the former reſpect, the <hi>integrum</hi> is the entire local fabrick of that divine houſe, city, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and dining chamber, with all its parts, furniture, and poſſeſſors; its integrals are both real or quantitive, and perſonal or relative. The real are, 1. the place of Gods diſcernable preſence, as the Father. 2. The place of Chriſts viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. 3. The place of the Holy Ghoſts manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive preſence. 4. The ſeveral manſions of every Son and Daughter of God. 5. The ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every Angel. 6. The ſeveral places of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170225:168"/> every ornament of the whole, or any part, which what they be are not revealed, but in a module or reſemblance, fitted to the capacity of man on earth; and to the expreſſion of the greateſt glory on earth, propheſied and promiſed to <hi>Iſrael, Rev.</hi> 21. &amp; 22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. to 48.</p>
                     <p>The perſonal are the ſeveral perſons poſſeſſing all thoſe places; who all have alſo a relative reſpect to each other, and that both lineal and collateral.</p>
